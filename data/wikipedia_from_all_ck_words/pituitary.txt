in vertebrate anatomy the pituitary gland or hypophysis is an endocrine gland about the size of a pea and weighing 0.5 grams (0.018 oz) in humans it is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain the hypophysis rests upon the hypophysial fossa of the sphenoid bone in the center of the middle cranial fossa and is surrounded by a small bony cavity (sella turcica) covered by a dural fold (diaphragma sellae) the anterior pituitary (or adenohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that regulates several physiological processes (including stress growth reproduction and lactation) the intermediate lobe synthesizes and secretes melanocyte-stimulating hormone the posterior pituitary (or neurohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence via a small tube called the pituitary stalk (also called the infundibular stalk or the infundibulum)
hormones secreted from the pituitary gland help control growth blood pressure certain functions of the sex organs thyroid glands and metabolism as well as some aspects of pregnancy childbirth nursing water/salt concentration and the kidneys temperature regulation and pain relief
== structureedit ==
the pituitary gland in humans is a pea-sized gland that sits in a protective bony enclosure called the sella turcica it is composed of three lobes anterior intermediate and posterior in many animals these three lobes are distinct the intermediate lobe is present in many species in particular in rodents mice and rats that have been used extensively to study pituitary development and function but it regresses in humans at about the 15th week of gestation it is thus absent from the adult human pituitary gland in all animals the fleshy glandular anterior pituitary is distinct from the neural composition of the posterior pituitary which is an extension of the ventral diencephalon or hypothalamus
=== anterioredit ===
the anterior pituitary arises from an invagination of the oral ectoderm and forms rathke's pouch this contrasts with the posterior pituitary which originates from neuroectoderm
endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are controlled by regulatory hormones released by parvocellular neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus the latter release regulatory hormones into hypothalamic capillaries leading to infundibular blood vessels which in turn lead to a second capillary bed in the anterior pituitary this vascular relationship constitutes the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system diffusing out of the second capillary bed the hypothalamic releasing hormones then bind to anterior pituitary endocrine cells upregulating or downregulating their release of hormones
the anterior lobe of the pituitary can be divided into the pars tuberalis (pars glandularis) and pars distalis (pars glandularis) that constitutes ~80% of the gland the pars intermedia (the intermediate lobe) lies between the pars distalis and the pars tuberalis and is rudimentary in the human although in other species it is more developed it develops from a depression in the dorsal wall of the pharynx (stomal part) known as rathke's pouch
=== posterioredit ===
the posterior lobe develops as an extension of the hypothalamus the magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the posterior side possess cell bodies located in the hypothalamus that project axons down the infundibulum to terminals in the posterior pituitary this simple arrangement differs sharply from that of the adjacent anterior pituitary which does not develop from the hypothalamus the release of pituitary hormones by both the anterior and posterior lobes is under the control of the hypothalamus albeit in different ways
== functionedit ==
=== anterioredit ===
the anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes hormones all releasing hormones (-rh) referred to can also be referred to as releasing factors (-rf)
somatotrophins
human growth hormone (hgh) also referred to as growth hormone (gh) and also as somatotropin is released under the influence of hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (ghrh) and is inhibited by hypothalamic somatostatin
thyrotrophins
thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) is released under the influence of hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) and is inhibited by somatostatin
corticotropins
adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth) and beta-endorphin are released under the influence of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh)
lactotrophins
prolactin (prl) also known as luteotropic hormone (lth) whose release is inconsistently stimulated by hypothalamic trh oxytocin vasopressin vasoactive intestinal peptide angiotensin ii neuropeptide y galanin substance p bombesin-like peptides (gastrin-releasing peptide neuromedin b and c) and neurotensin and inhibited by hypothalamic dopamine
gonadotropins
luteinizing hormone (also referred to as lutropin or lh')
follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) both released under influence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh)
these hormones are released from the anterior pituitary under the influence of the hypothalamus hypothalamic hormones are secreted to the anterior lobe by way of a special capillary system called the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal system
=== intermediateedit ===
the intermediate lobe synthesizes and secretes the following important endocrine hormone
melanocytestimulating hormone (msh) this is also produced in the anterior lobe when produced in the intermediate lobe mshs are sometimes called intermedins
=== posterioredit ===
the posterior pituitary stores and secretes (but does not synthesize) the following important endocrine hormones
magnocellular neurons
antidiuretic hormone (adh also known as vasopressin and arginine vasopressin avp) the majority of which is released from the supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus
oxytocin most of which is released from the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus oxytocin is one of the few hormones to create a positive feedback loop for example uterine contractions stimulate the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary which in turn increases uterine contractions this positive feedback loop continues throughout labour
=== hormonesedit ===
hormones secreted from the pituitary gland help control the following body processes
growth
blood pressure
some aspects of pregnancy and childbirth including stimulation of uterine contractions during childbirth
breast milk production
sex organ functions in both males and females
thyroid gland function
the conversion of food into energy (metabolism)
water and osmolarity regulation in the body
water balance via the control of reabsorption of water by the kidneys
temperature regulation
pain relief
sleeping patterns (pineal gland)
== clinical significanceedit ==
some of the diseases involving the pituitary gland are
central diabetes insipidus caused by a deficiency of vasopressin
gigantism and acromegaly caused by an excess of growth hormone in childhood and adult respectively
hypothyroidism caused by a deficiency of thyroid-stimulating hormone
hyperpituitarism the increased (hyper) secretion of one or more of the hormones normally produced by the pituitary gland
hypopituitarism the decreased (hypo) secretion of one or more of the hormones normally produced by the pituitary gland
panhypopituitarism a decreased secretion of most of the pituitary hormones
pituitary tumours
pituitary adenomas noncancerous tumors that occur in the pituitary gland
all of the functions of the pituitary gland can be adversely affected by an over or under production of associated hormones
the pituitary gland is important for mediating the stress response via the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (hpa) axis critically pituitary gland growth during adolescence can be altered by early life stress such as childhood maltreatment or maternal dysphoric behavior
== historyedit ==
=== etymologyedit ===
==== pituitary glandedit ====
the greek physician galen referred to the pituitary gland by only using the (ancient greek) name  gland he described the pituitary gland as part of a series of secretory organs for the excretion of nasal mucus anatomist andreas vesalius translated with glans in quam pituita destillat gland in which slime (pituita) drips besides this descriptive name vesalius used glandula pituitaria from which the english name pituitary gland is ultimately derived
the expression glandula pituitaria is still used as official synonym beside hypophysis in the official latin nomenclature terminologia anatomica in the seventeenth century the supposed function of the pituitary gland to produce nasal mucus was debunked the expression glandula pituitaria and its english equivalent pituitary gland can only be justified from a historical point of view the inclusion of this synonym is merely justified by noting that the main term hypophysis is a much less popular term
==== hypophysisedit ====
the anatomist samuel thomas von smmerring coined the name hypophysis this name consists of ('under') and ('to grow') in later greek is used differently by greek physicians as outgrowth smmering also used the equivalent expression appendix cerebri with appendix as appendage in various languages hirnanhang in german and hersenaanhangsel in dutch the terms are derived from appendix cerebri
== other animalsedit ==
the pituitary gland is found in all vertebrates but its structure varies between different groups
the division of the pituitary described above is typical of mammals and is also true to varying degrees of all tetrapods however only in mammals does the posterior pituitary have a compact shape in lungfish it is a relatively flat sheet of tissue lying above the anterior pituitary but in amphibians reptiles and birds it becomes increasingly well developed the intermediate lobe is in general not well developed in any species and is entirely absent in birds
the structure of the pituitary in fish apart from the lungfish is generally different from that in other animals in general the intermediate lobe tends to be well developed and may equal the remainder of the anterior pituitary in size the posterior lobe typically forms a sheet of tissue at the base of the pituitary stalk and in most cases sends irregular finger-like projection into the tissue of the anterior pituitary which lies directly beneath it the anterior pituitary is typically divided into two regions a more anterior rostral portion and a posterior proximal portion but the boundary between the two is often not clearly marked in elasmobranchs there is an additional ventral lobe beneath the anterior pituitary proper
the arrangement in lampreys which are among the most primitive of all fish may indicate how the pituitary originally evolved in ancestral vertebrates here the posterior pituitary is a simple flat sheet of tissue at the base of the brain and there is no pituitary stalk rathke's pouch remains open to the outside close to the nasal openings closely associated with the pouch are three distinct clusters of glandular tissue corresponding to the intermediate lobe and the rostral and proximal portions of the anterior pituitary these various parts are separated by meningial membranes suggesting that the pituitary of other vertebrates may have formed from the fusion of a pair of separate but associated glands
most armadillos also possess a neural secretory gland very similar in form to the posterior pituitary but located in the tail and associated with the spinal cord this may have a function in osmoregulation
there is a structure analogous to the pituitary in the octopus brain
=== intermediate lobeedit ===
although rudimentary in humans (and often considered part of the anterior pituitary) the intermediate lobe located between the anterior and posterior pituitary is important to many animals for instance in fish it is believed to control physiological color change in adult humans it is just a thin layer of cells between the anterior and posterior pituitary the intermediate lobe produces melanocyte-stimulating hormone (msh) although this function is often (imprecisely) attributed to the anterior pituitary
the intermediate lobe is in general not well developed in tetrapods and is entirely absent in birds
