chemistry neutralization us spelling neutralisation uk spelling chemical reaction acid base react quantitatively reaction water neutralization results excess hydrogen hydroxide ions present solution ph neutralized solution depends acid strength reactants neutralization used many applications
meaning neutralization
context chemical reaction term neutralization used reaction acid base alkali historically reaction represented
acid base salt water
example
hcl naoh nacl ho
statement still valid long understood aqueous solution substances involved subject dissociation changes substances ionization state arrow sign used reaction complete said neutralization quantitative reaction general definition based brnstedlowry acidbase theory
ah bz bhz
ah represents acid b represents base z electric charge negative anion zero positive cation reaction takes place water base hydroxide ion oh reaction written
ah oh ho
acid neutralization molecules ah hydrogen ions produced dissociation molecule left since acid molecules present initially neutral form ionized ie charged term acid neutralization therefore implies acid effects rather charge neutralization electrical terms acid neutralization thus corresponds acid ionization reaction amount base added must moreover equal amount acid present initially amount base said equivalent amount titration acid base point neutralization also called equivalence point quantitative nature neutralization reaction conveniently expressed terms concentrations acid alkali equivalence point
volume acid concentration h ions dissociation volume base concentration oh ions
general acid ahn concentration c reacting base bohm concentration c volumes related
n v c m v c
concept neutralization limited reactions solution example reaction limestone acid sulfuric acid also neutralization reaction
camgcos hsoaq camgsos cog ho
reactions important soil chemistry
strong acids strong bases
strong acid one fully dissociated aqueous solution example hydrochloric acid hcl strong acid
hclaq haq claq
strong base one fully dissociated aqueous solution example sodium hydroxide naoh strong base
naohaq naaq ohaq
therefore strong acid reacts strong base neutralization reaction written
h oh ho
example reaction hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide sodium chloride ions na cl take part reaction reaction consistent brnstedlowry definition reality hydrogen ion exists hydronium ion neutralization reaction may written
ho oh ho ho
strong acid neutralized strong base excess hydrogen ions left solution solution said neutral neither acidic alkaline ph solution close value exact ph value dependent temperature solution
neutralization exothermic reaction standard enthalpy change reaction h oh ho kjmol
weak acids strong bases
weak acid one dissociate fully dissolved water instead equilibrium mixture formed
ah ho ho
acetic acid example weak acid ph neutralized solution close strong acid depends acid dissociation constant pkaof acid ph endpoint equivalence point titration may easily calculated endpoint acid completely neutralized analytical hydrogen ion concentration th zero concentration conjugate base effectively equal analytical concentration acid writing ah acid ta defining acid dissociation constant pka
ha kaah pka logka
selfdissociation constant water kw
kw hoh pkw logkw
equation massbalance hydrogen ions easy write
th h kaah kwh
term kwh equal concentration hydroxide ions neutralization th zero
h kaah kwh
h katah kw
h kw kata
log h log kw log kata
ph pkw log taka
circumstances term taka much larger equal taka good approximation
ph pkw pka log ta
equation explains following facts
ph endpoint depends mainly strength acid pka
ph endpoint also depends concentration acid ta
ph rises steeply endpoint acid concentration increases
weak acid titrated strong base endpoint occurs ph greater therefore suitable indicator use one like phenolphthalein changes color high ph
weak bases strong acids
situation analogous weak acids strong bases
ho b ho bh
ph neutralized solution depends acid dissociation constant base pka equivalently base association constant pkb
suitable indicator use type titration one like methyl orange changes color low ph
weak acids weak bases
weak acid reacts equivalent amount weak base complete neutralization occur
ah b bh
concentrations species equilibrium depend equilibrium constant k reaction defined follows
abh kahb
given association constants acid ka base kb
h ah ah kaah
b h bh bh kbbh
follows k ka kb
weak acid cannot neutralized weak base vice versa
applications
chemical titration methods used analyzing acids bases determine unknown concentration either ph meter ph indicator shows point neutralization distinct color change employed simple stoichiometric calculations known volume unknown known volume molarity added chemical gives molarity unknown
wastewater treatment chemical neutralization methods often applied reduce damage effluent may cause upon release environment ph control popular chemicals include calcium carbonate calcium oxide magnesium hydroxide sodium bicarbonate selection appropriate neutralization chemical depends particular application
many uses neutralization reactions acidalkali reactions common use antacid tablets designed neutralize excess gastric acid stomach hcl may causing discomfort stomach lower esophagus also remedied ingestion sodium bicarbonate nahco
also digestive tract neutralization reactions used food moved stomach intestines order nutrients absorbed intestinal wall alkaline environment needed pancreas produce antacid bicarbonate cause transformation occur
another common use though perhaps widely known fertilizers control soil ph slaked lime calcium hydroxide limestone calcium carbonate may worked soil acidic plant growth fertilizers improve plant growth made neutralizing sulfuric acid hso nitric acid hno ammonia gas nh making ammonium sulfate ammonium nitrate salts utilized fertilizer
industrially byproduct burning coal sulfur dioxide gas may combine water vapor air eventually produce sulfuric acid falls acid rain prevent sulfur dioxide released device known scrubber gleans gas smoke stacks device first blows calcium carbonate combustion chamber decomposes calcium oxide lime carbon dioxide lime reacts sulfur dioxide produced forming calcium sulfite suspension lime injected mixture produce slurry removes calcium sulfite remaining unreacted sulfur dioxide
