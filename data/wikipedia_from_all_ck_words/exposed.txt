== name ==
the word twelve is the largest number with a single-syllable name in english early germanic numbers have been theorized to have been non-decimal evidence includes the unusual phrasing of eleven and twelve the former use of hundred to refer to groups of 120 and the presence of glosses such as tentywise or ten-count in medieval texts showing that writers could not presume their readers would normally understand them that way such uses gradually disappeared with the introduction of arabic numerals during the 12th-century renaissance
it derives from the old english twelf and tuelf first attested in the 10th-century lindisfarne gospels book of john it has cognates in every germanic language whose proto-germanic ancestor has been reconstructed as *twalii... from *twa ("two") and suffix *-lif- or *-li- of uncertain meaning it is sometimes compared with the lithuanian dvlika although -lika is used as the suffix for all numbers from 11 to 19 (analogous to -teen") every other indo-european language instead uses a form of two"+"ten such as the latin dudecim the usual ordinal form is twelfth but dozenth or duodecimal (from the latin word) is also used in some contexts particularly base-12 numeration similarly a group of twelve things is usually a dozen but may also be referred to as a duodecad the adjective referring to a group of twelve is duodecuple
as with eleven the earliest forms of twelve are often considered to be connected with proto-germanic *lian or *lian ("to leave") with the implicit meaning that two is left after having already counted to ten the lithuanian suffix is also considered to share a similar development the suffix *-lif- has also been connected with reconstructions of the proto-germanic for ten

twelve is a composite number the smallest number with exactly six divisors its divisors being 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 twelve is also a highly composite number the next one being twenty-four twelve is also a superior highly composite number the next one being sixty it is the first composite number of the form p2q a square-prime and also the first member of the (p2) family in this form 12 has an aliquot sum of 16 (133% in abundance) accordingly 12 is the first abundant number (in fact a superabundant number) and demonstrates an 8-member aliquot sequence {12,16,15,9,4,3,1,0} 12 is the 3rd composite number in the 3-aliquot tree the only number which has 12 as its aliquot sum is the square 121 only 2 other square primes are abundant (18 and 20)
twelve is a sublime number a number that has a perfect number of divisors and the sum of its divisors is also a perfect number since there is a subset of 12's proper divisors that add up to 12 (all of them but with 4 excluded) 12 is a semiperfect number
if an odd perfect number is of the form 12k + 1 it has at least twelve distinct prime factors
twelve is a superfactorial being the product of the first three factorials twelve being the product of three and four the first four positive integers show up in the equation 12 = 3 4 which can be continued with the equation 56 = 7 8
twelve is the ninth perrin number preceded in the sequence by 5 7 10 and also appears in the padovan sequence preceded by the terms 5 7 9 (it is the sum of the first two of these) it is the fourth pell number preceded in the sequence by 2 and 5 (it is the sum of the former plus twice the latter)

twelve is the smallest weight for which a cusp form exists this cusp form is the discriminant (q) whose fourier coefficients are given by the ramanujan -function and which is (up to a constant multiplier) the 24th power of the dedekind eta function this fact is related to a constellation of interesting appearances of the number twelve in mathematics ranging from the value of the riemann zeta function at 1 i.e (1) = 1/12 the fact that the abelianization of sl(2,z) has twelve elements and even the properties of lattice polygons
there are twelve jacobian elliptic functions and twelve cubic distance-transitive graphs
there are 12 latin squares of size 33
the duodecimal system (1210 [twelve] = 1012) which is the use of 12 as a division factor for many ancient and medieval weights and measures including hours probably originates from mesopotamia
