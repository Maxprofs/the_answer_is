toes are the digits of the foot of a tetrapod animal species such as cats that walk on their toes are described as being digitigrade humans and other animals that walk on the soles of their feet are described as being plantigrade unguligrade animals are those that walk on hooves at the tips of their toes
== structureedit ==
the toe refers to a part of the human foot with five toes present on each human foot each toe consists of three phalanx bones the proximal middle and distal with the exception of the big toe (latin hallux) the hallux only contains two phalanx bones the proximal and distal the phalanx bones of the toe join to the metatarsal bones of the foot at the interphalangeal joints outside the hallux bones is skin and present on all five toes is a toenail
the toes are from medial to lateral
the first toe also known as the hallux ("big toe or great toe") the innermost toe
the second toe or long toe
the third toe or middle toe
the fourth toe or ring toe
the fifth toe little toe pinky toe or baby toe the outermost toe
=== musclesedit ===
toe movement is generally flexion and extension via muscular tendons that attach to the toes on the anterior and superior surfaces of the phalanx bones
with the exception of the hallux toe movement is generally governed by action of the flexor digitorum brevis and extensor digitorum brevis muscles these attach to the sides of the bones making it impossible to move individual toes independently muscles between the toes on their top and bottom also help to bring abduct and adduct the toes the hallux and little toe have unique muscles
the hallux is primarily flexed by the flexor hallucis longus muscle located in the deep posterior of the lower leg via the flexor hallucis longus tendon additional flexion control is provided by the flexor hallucis brevis it is extended by the abductor hallucis muscle and the adductor hallucis muscle
the little toe has a separate set of control muscles and tendon attachments the flexor and abductor digiti minimi numerous other foot muscles contribute to fine motor control of the foot the connective tendons between the minor toes accounts for the inability to actuate individual toes
=== blood supplyedit ===
the toes receive blood from the digital branches of the plantar metatarsal arteries and drain blood into the dorsal venous arch of the foot
=== innervationedit ===
sensation to the skin of the toes is provided by five nerves the superficial fibular nerve supplies sensation to the top of the toes except between the hallux and second toe which is supplied by the deep fibular nerve and the outer surface of the fifth toe supplied by the sural nerve sensation to the bottom of the toes is supplied by the medial plantar nerve which supplies sensation to the great toe and inner three-and-a-half toes and the lateral plantar nerve which supplies sensation to the little toe and half of the sensation of the fourth toe
=== sizeedit ===
in humans the hallux is usually longer than the second toe but in some individuals it may not be the longest toe there is an inherited trait in humans where the dominant gene causes a longer second toe ("morton's toe or greek foot") while the homozygous recessive genotype presents with the more common trait a longer hallux people with the rare genetic disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva characteristically have a short hallux which appears to turn inward or medially in relation to the foot
the fifth toe is the outermost and usually the smallest toe of the foot
=== variationedit ===
humans usually have five toes on each foot when more than five toes are present this is known as polydactyly other variants may include syndactyly or arachnodactyly forefoot shape including toe shape exhibits significant variation among people these differences can be measured and have been statistically correlated with ethnicity such deviations may affect comfort and fit for various shoe types research conducted for the u.s army indicated that larger feet may still have smaller arches toe length and toe-breadth
== functionedit ==
the human foot consists of multiple bones and soft tissues which support the weight of the upright human specifically the toes assist the human while walking providing balance weight-bearing and thrust during the gait
== clinical relevanceedit ==
a sprain or strain to the small interphalangeal joints of the toe is commonly called a stubbed toe a sprain or strain where the toe joins to the foot is called turf toe
long-term use of improperly sized shoes can cause misalignment of toes as well as other orthopedic problems
morton's neuroma commonly results in pain and numbness between the third and fourth toes of the sufferer due to it affecting the nerve between the third and fourth metatarsal bones
the big toe is also the most common locus of ingrown nails and gout attacks
=== deformityedit ===
deformities of the foot include hammer toe trigger toe and claw toe hammer toe can be described as an abnormal contraction or buckling of a toe this is done by a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints which form the toes since the toes are deformed further these may press against a shoe and cause pain deformities of the foot can also be caused by rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus deformities may predispose to ulcers and pain especially when shoe-wearing
a common problem involving the big toe is the formation of bunions these are structural deformities of the bones and the joint between the foot and big toe and may be painful similar deformity involving the fifth toe is described as tailor's bunion or bunionette
=== in reconstructionedit ===
a favourable option for the reconstruction of missing adjacent fingers/multiple digit amputations i.e such as a metacarpal hand reconstruction is to have a combined second and third toe transplantation third and fourth toe transplantation are also good
== historyedit ==
=== etymologyedit ===
==== taedit ====
the old english term for toe is ta (plural tan) this is a contraction of tahe and derives from proto-germanic taihwo (cognates old norse ta old frisian tane middle dutch te dutch teen (perhaps originally a plural) old high german zecha german zehe) perhaps originally meaning fingers as well (many proto-indo-european language (pie) languages still use one word to mean both fingers and toes) and thus from pie root deik to show
==== halluxedit ====
in classical latin hallex allex hallus and allus with genitive (h)allicis and (h)alli are used to refer to the big toe the form hallux (genitive hallucis) currently in use is however a blend word of the aforementioned forms compare pollex the equivalent term for the thumb
== in other animalsedit ==
in birds with anisodactyl or heterodactyl feet the hallux is opposed or directed backwards and allows for grasping and perching
while the thumb is often mentioned as one of the signature characteristics in humans this manual digit remains partially primitive and is actually present in all primates in humans the most derived digital feature is the hallux
