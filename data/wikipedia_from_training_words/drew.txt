hydrangea (/hadrend/ common names hydrangea or hortensia) is a genus of 7075 species of flowering plants native to southern and eastern asia (china japan korea the himalayas and indonesia) and the americas by far the greatest species diversity is in eastern asia notably china japan and korea most are shrubs 1 to 3 meters tall but some are small trees and others lianas reaching up to 30 m (98 ft) by climbing up trees they can be either deciduous or evergreen though the widely cultivated temperate species are all deciduous
having been introduced to the azores h macrophylla is now very common particularly on faial which is known as the blue island due to the vast number of hydrangeas present on the island
species in the related genus schizophragma also in hydrangeaceae are also often known as hydrangeas schizophragma hydrangeoides and hydrangea petiolaris are both commonly known as climbing hydrangeas
there are two flower arrangements in hydrangeas mophead flowers are large round flowerheads resembling pom-poms or as the name implies the head of a mop in contrast lacecap flowers bear round flat flowerheads with a center core of subdued fertile flowers surrounded by outer rings of showy sterile flowers the flowers of some rhododendrons can appear similar to those of some hydrangeas but rhododendron (including azalea) is in a different order
== life cycleedit ==
hydrangea flowers are produced from early spring to late autumn they grow in flowerheads (corymbs or panicles) at the ends of the stems in many species the flowerheads contain two types of flowers small fertile flowers in the middle of the flowerhead and large sterile bract-like flowers in a ring around the edge of each flowerhead other species have all the flowers sterile and of the same size
== colors and soil acidityedit ==
in most species the flowers are white but in some species (notably h macrophylla) can be blue red pink light purple or dark purple in these species the color is affected by soil ph for h macrophylla and h serrata cultivars the flower color can be determined by the relative acidity of the soil an acidic soil (ph below 7) by the influence of sundry agents in the soil such as alum or iron will usually produce flower color closer to blue whereas an alkaline soil (ph above 7) will produce pinker flowers this is caused by a color change of the flower pigments in the presence of aluminium ions which can be taken up into hyperaccumulating plants

== cultivation and usesedit ==
hydrangeas are popular ornamental plants grown for their large flowerheads with hydrangea macrophylla being by far the most widely grown with over 600 named cultivars many selected to have only large sterile flowers in the flowerheads some are best pruned on an annual basis when the new leaf buds begin to appear if not pruned regularly the bush will become very leggy growing upwards until the weight of the stems is greater than their strength at which point the stems will sag down to the ground and possibly break other species only flower on old wood thus new wood resulting from pruning will not produce flowers until the following season
hydrangea root and rhizome are indicated for treatment of conditions of the urinary tract in the pdr for herbal medicine and may have diuretic properties hydrangeas are moderately toxic if eaten with all parts of the plant containing cyanogenic glycosides hydrangea paniculata is reportedly sometimes smoked as an intoxicant despite the danger of illness and/or death due to the cyanide
