the four cardinal directions or cardinal points are the directions of north east south and west commonly denoted by their initials n e s w east and west are at right angles to north and south with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass the intermediate (intercardinal or ordinal) directions are northeast (ne) southeast (se) southwest (sw) and northwest (nw) further the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right i.e nne ene ese and so on
== locating the directions ==
=== direction versus bearing ===
to keep to a bearing is not in general the same as going in a straight direction along a great circle conversely one can keep to a great circle and the bearing may change thus the bearing of a straight path crossing the north pole changes abruptly at the pole from north to south when travelling east or west it is only on the equator that one can keep east or west and be going straight (without need to steer) anywhere else maintaining latitude requires a change in direction requires steering however this change in direction becomes increasingly negligible as one moves to lower latitudes
=== magnetic compass ===
the earth has a magnetic field which is approximately aligned with its axis of rotation a magnetic compass is a device that uses this field to determine the cardinal directions magnetic compasses are extremely widely used but only moderately accurate
=== the sun ===
the position of the sun in the sky can be used for orientation if the general time of day is known in the morning the sun rises roughly in the east (due east only on the equinoxes) and tracks upwards in the evening it sets in the west again roughly and only due west exactly on the equinoxes in the middle of the day it is to the south for viewers in the northern hemisphere who live north of the tropic of cancer and the north for those in the southern hemisphere who live south of the tropic of capricorn this method works less well closer to the equator (i.e between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn) since in the northern hemisphere the sun may be directly overhead or even to the north in summer conversely at low latitudes in the southern hemisphere the sun may be to the south of the observer in summer in these locations one needs first to determine whether the sun is moving from east to west through north or south by watching its movementsleft to right means it is going through south while right to left means it is going through north or one can watch the sun's shadows if they move clockwise the sun will be in the south at midday and if they move anticlockwise then the sun will be in the north at midday
due to the earth's axial tilt no matter what the location of the viewer there are only two days each year when the sun rises precisely due east these days are the equinoxes on all other days depending on the time of year the sun rises either north or south of true east (and sets north or south of true west) for all locations the sun is seen to rise north of east (and set north of west) from the northward equinox to the southward equinox and rise south of east (and set south of west) from the southward equinox to the northward equinox
a more accurate fix can be made if the time of year and approximate latitude are factored in the amount that the sun appears to be either north or south depends on both the time of year and latitude of the observer knowing these will enable the observer to be more precise when determining the cardinal directions from the sun's position particularly in the early morning or late afternoon
=== watch face ===
there is a traditional method by which an analog watch can be used to locate north and south the sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour clock face takes twelve hours to complete one rotation in the northern hemisphere if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the sun the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south for this method to work in the southern hemisphere the 12 is pointed toward the sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north during daylight saving time the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12 there are minor inaccuracies due to the difference between local time and zone time and due to the equation of time corrections can be made for these errors
this method assumes that the azimuth (compass bearing) of the sun changes at a constant rate throughout the day strictly this is true only if the observer is at one of the earth's poles close to the equator the sun's azimuth changes at very different speeds at different times of day and even sometimes reverses direction (see footnote for examples.) this completely invalidates this method of using a watch as a compass in tropical and low-temperate latitudes however at fairly high latitudes more than about 50 degrees north or south the speed of the sun's change of azimuth is sufficiently constant to allow the method to be accurate enough for simple purposes the method originated in the united kingdom which is almost entirely to the north of 50n latitude british boy scouts and girl guides frequently use it
the photograph shows a specialized 24-hour watch designed for finding directions using the sun at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere with the watch set to indicate local time the hour hand is pointed directly at the sun north is then indicated by the local midnight position
=== sundial ===
a portable sundial can be used as a more accurate instrument than a watch for determining the cardinal directions since the design of a sundial takes account of the latitude of the observer it can be used at any latitude see sundial#using a sundial as a compass
=== astronomy ===
astronomy provides a method for finding direction at night all the stars appear to lie on the imaginary celestial sphere because of the rotation of the earth the celestial sphere appears to rotate around an axis passing through the north and south poles of the earth this axis intersects the celestial sphere at the north and south celestial poles which appear to the observer to lie directly above due north and south respectively on the horizon
in either hemisphere observations of the night sky show that the visible stars appear to be moving in circular paths caused by the rotation of the earth this is best seen in a long exposure photograph which is obtained by locking the shutter open for most of the intensely dark part of a moonless night the resulting photograph reveals a multitude of concentric arcs (portions of perfect circles) from which the exact center can be readily derived and which corresponds to the celestial pole which lies directly above the position of the true pole (north or south) on the horizon a published photograph exposed for nearly 8 hours demonstrates this effect
the northern celestial pole is currently (but not permanently) within a fraction of 1 degree of the bright star polaris the exact position of the pole changes over thousands of years due to the precession of the equinoxes polaris is also known as the north star and is generically called a pole star or lodestar polaris is only visible during fair weather at night to inhabitants of the northern hemisphere the asterism big dipper may be used to find polaris the 2 corner stars of the pan (those opposite from the handle) point above the top of the pan to polaris
while observers in the northern hemisphere can use the star polaris to determine the northern celestial pole the octans constellation's south star is hardly visible enough to use for navigation for this reason the preferred alternative is to use the constellation crux (the southern cross) the southern celestial pole lies at the intersection of (a) the line along the long axis of crux (i.e through alpha crucis and gamma crucis) and (b) a line perpendicularly bisecting the line joining the pointers (alpha centauri and beta centauri)
=== inertial navigation ===
at the very end of the 19th century to avoid the need to wait for fair weather at night to precisely verify one's alignment with true north the gyrocompass was developed for ship use in scenarios where the magnetic compass simply wasn't good enough it has the further advantages of immunity to interference by stray magnetic fields and not depending on earth's magnetic field at all its major disadvantage is that it depends on technology that many individuals might find too expensive to justify outside the context of a large commercial or military operation it also requires a continuous power supply for its motors and that it be allowed to sit in one location for a period of time while it properly aligns itself
=== satellite navigation ===
near the end of the 20th century the advent of satellite-based global positioning systems (gps) provided yet another means for any individual to determine true north accurately while gps receivers (gpsrs) function best with a clear view of the entire sky they function day or night and in all but the most severe weather the government agencies responsible for the satellites continuously monitor and adjust them to maintain their accurate alignment with the earth there are consumer versions of the receivers that are attractively priced since there are no periodic access fees or other licensing charges they have become widely used gpsr functionality is becoming more commonly added to other consumer devices such as mobile phones handheld gpsrs have modest power requirements can be shut down as needed and recalibrate within a couple of minutes of being restarted in contrast with the gyrocompass which is most accurate when stationary the gps receiver if it has only one antenna must be moving typically at more than 0.1 mph (0.2 km/h) to correctly display compass directions on ships and aircraft gps receivers are often equipped with two or more antennas separately attached to the vehicle the exact latitudes and longitudes of the antennas are determined which allows the cardinal directions to be calculated relative to the structure of the vehicle within these limitations gpsrs are considered both accurate and reliable the gpsr has thus become the fastest and most convenient way to obtain a verifiable alignment with the cardinal directions
== additional points ==
the directional names are also routinely and very conveniently associated with the degrees of rotation in the unit circle a necessary step for navigational calculations (derived from trigonometry) and/or for use with global positioning satellite (gps) receivers the four cardinal directions correspond to the following degrees of a compass
north (n) 0 = 360
east (e) 90
south (s) 180
west (w) 270
an intercardinal or ordinal or intermediate direction is one of the four intermediate compass directions located halfway between the cardinal directions
northeast (ne) 45 halfway between north and east is the opposite of southwest
southeast (se) 135 halfway between south and east is the opposite of northwest
southwest (sw) 225 halfway between south and west is the opposite of northeast
northwest (nw) 315 halfway between north and west is the opposite of southeast
these 8 words have been further compounded resulting in a total of 32 named points evenly spaced around the compass north (n) north by east (nbe) north-northeast (nne) northeast by north (nebn) northeast (ne) northeast by east (nebe) east-northeast (ene) east by north (ebn) east (e) etc
== usefulness of cardinal points ==
with the cardinal points thus accurately defined by convention cartographers draw standard maps with north (n) at the top and east (e) at the right in turn maps provide a systematic means to record where places are and cardinal directions are the foundation of a structure for telling someone how to find those places
north does not have to be at the top most maps in medieval europe for example placed east (e) at the top a few cartographers prefer south-up maps many portable gps-based navigation computers today can be set to display maps either conventionally (n always up e always right) or with the current instantaneous direction of travel called the heading always up (and whatever direction is +90 from that to the right)
the direction of travel required to reach the intended destination is called the bearing since the real world presents numerous obstacles a person must adjust his or her heading accordingly upon moving forward the bearing will change so that it always points at the destination thereby giving clues as to which way to turn when travelling it is often easier to work out where the next turn is and whether to turn left or right when the direction of travel is always up
== beyond geography ==
in mathematics cardinal directions or cardinal points are the six principal directions or points along the x- y- and z-axis of three-dimensional space
in the real world there are six cardinal directions not involved with geography which are north south east west up and down in this context up and down relate to elevation altitude or possibly depth (if water is involved) the topographic map is a special case of cartography in which the elevation is indicated on the map typically via contour lines
in astronomy cardinal points of the disk of an astronomical body may be four points defined by the direction in which the celestial poles are located as seen from the center of the disk
a line (here it is a great circle on the celestial sphere) drawn from the center of the disk to the north celestial pole will intersect the body's limb at the north point similarly a line from the center to the south celestial pole will define the south point by its intersection with the limb the points at right angles to the north and south points are the east and west points the north point will then be the point on the limb that is closest to the north celestial pole
== germanic origin of names ==
during the migration period the germanic languages names for the cardinal directions entered the romance languages where they replaced the latin names borealis (or septentrionalis) with north australis (or meridionalis) with south occidentalis with west and orientalis with east it is possible that some northern people used the germanic names for the intermediate directions medieval scandinavian orientation would thus have involved a 45 degree rotation of cardinal directions
north (proto-germanic *nor-) from the proto-indo-european *nrto-s submerged from the root *ner- left below to the left of the rising sun whence comes the ancient greek name nereus
east (*aus-t-) from the word for dawn the proto-indo-european form is *austo-s from the root is *aues- shine (red) see ostre
south (*sun-) derived from proto-indo-european *s-n-to-s from the root *seu- seethe boil cognate with this root is the word sun thus the region of the sun.
west (*wes-t-) from a word for evening. the proto-indo-european form is *uestos from the root *ues- shine (red) itself a form of *aues- cognate with the root are the latin words vesper and vesta and the ancient greek hestia hesperus and hesperides
== cardinal directions in world cultures ==
many cultures not descended from european traditions use cardinal directions but have a number other than four typically a center direction is added for a total of five rather than the western use of direction letters properties such as colors are often associated with the various cardinal directionsthese are typically the natural colors of human perception rather than optical primary colors some examples are shown here in many regions of the world prevalent winds change direction seasonally and consequently many cultures associate specific named winds with cardinal and intercardinal directions the classical greeks personified these winds as anemoi when boxing the compass into intercardinal subdirections each corresponds to one of the directional winds into the mediterranean sea (for example south-east is linked to sirocco the wind from the sahara)
=== arabic language ===
countries where arabic is used refer to the cardinal directions as ash shamaliyah (n) al gharbiyah (w) ash sharqiyah (e) and al janobiyah (s) additionally al wusta is used for the center all five are used for geographic subdivision names (wilayahs states regions governorates provinces districts or even towns) and some are the origin of some southern iberian place names (such as algarve portugal and axarqua spain)
=== far east ===
dynastic chinese culture and some other central asian cultures view the center as a fifth principal direction hence the english translated term five cardinal points where it is different than the west is that the term is used as a foundation for i ching the wu xing and the five naked-eye planets
in traditional chinese astrology the zodiacal belt is divided into the four constellation groups corresponding to the four cardinal directions
each direction is often identified with a color and (at least in china) with a mythological creature of that color geographical or ethnic terms may contain the name of the color instead of the name of the corresponding direction
east green ( qng corresponds to both green and blue) spring wood
qingdao (tsingtao) green island a city on the east coast of china
south red summer fire
red river (asia) south of china
red croatia
red ruthenia
west white autumn metal
white sheep turkmen
akdeniz meaning white sea mediterranean sea in turkish
belarus meaning white rus or white ruthenia
white serbia
white croatia
north black winter water
heilongjiang black dragon river province in northeast china also the amur river
kara-khitan khanate black khitans who originated in northern china
black sea north of anatolia
black ruthenia
center yellow earth
huangshan yellow mountain in central china
golden horde central army of the mongols
=== americas ===
in mesoamerica and north america a number of traditional indigenous cosmologies include four cardinal directions and a center some may also include above and below as directions and therefore focus on a cosmology of seven directions each direction may be associated with a color which can vary widely between nations but which is usually one of the basic colors found in nature and natural pigments such as black red white and yellow with occasional appearances of blue green or other hues in some cases e.g. many of the puebloan peoples of the southwestern united states the four named directions are not north south east and west but are the four intermediate directions associated with the places of sunrise and sunset at the winter and summer solstices there can be great variety in color symbolism even among cultures that are close neighbors geographically
=== australia ===
some indigenous australians have cardinal directions deeply embedded in their culture for example the warlpiri people have a cultural philosophy deeply connected to the four cardinal directions and the guugu yimithirr people use cardinal directions rather than relative direction even when indicating the position of an object close to their body (see use of cardinal direction instead of relative direction)
the precise direction of the cardinal points appears to be important in aboriginal stone arrangements
many aboriginal languages contain words for the usual four cardinal directions but some contain words for 5 or even 6 cardinal directions
== unique (non-compound) names of intercardinal directions ==
in some languages such as finnish estonian and breton the intercardinal directions have names that are not compounds of the names of the cardinal directions (as for instance northeast is compounded from north and east) in finnish those are koillinen (northeast) kaakko (southeast) lounas (southwest) and luode (northwest) compare with the non-compound names used for the numbers 1119 in english (eleven rather than *ten-one) and special names for one and a half and two and a half in many languages of india such as hindi and marathi in japanese there is the interesting situation that native japanese words (yamato kotoba kun readings of kanji) are used for the cardinal directions (such as minami for  south) but borrowed chinese words (on readings of kanji) are used for intercardinal directions (such as t-nan for  southeast lit east-south") in the malay language adding laut (sea) to either east (timur) or west (barat) results in northeast or northwest respectively whereas adding daya to west (giving barat daya) results in southwest however southeast has a special word tenggara
sanskrit and other indian languages that borrow from it use the names of the gods associated with each direction east (indra) southeast (agni) south (yama/dharma) southwest (nirrti) west (varuna) northwest (vayu) north (kubera/heaven) and northeast (ishana/shiva) north is associated with the himalayas and heaven while the south is associated with the underworld or land of the fathers (pitr loka) the directions are named by adding disha to the names of each god or entity e.g indradisha (direction of indra) or pitrdisha (direction of the forefathers i.e south)
== non-compass directional systems ==
use of the compass directions is common and deeply embedded in european culture and also in chinese culture (see south-pointing chariot) some other cultures make greater use of other referents such as towards the sea or towards the mountains (hawaii bali) or upstream and downstream (most notably in ancient egypt also in the yurok and karuk languages) lengo (guadalcanal solomon islands) has four non-compass directions landward seaward upcoast and downcoast
