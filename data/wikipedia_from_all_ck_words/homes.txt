in 2009 at the united nations economic commission for europe conference of european statisticians recommended that homeless people are classified in two broad groups (noting that that this would not provide a complete definition)
(a) primary homelessness (or rooflessness) this category includes persons living in the streets without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters
(b) secondary homelessness this category may include persons with no place of usual residence who move frequently between various types of accommodations (including dwellings shelters and institutions for the homeless or other living quarters) this category includes persons living in private dwellings but reporting no usual address on their census form

== psychological significance ==
a home is generally a place that is close to the heart of the owner and can become a prized possession it has been argued that psychologically the strongest sense of home commonly coincides geographically with a dwelling usually the sense of home attenuates as one moves away from that point but it does not do so in a fixed or regular way. since it can be said that humans are generally creatures of habit the state of a person's home has been known to physiologically influence their behavior emotions and overall mental health people may become homesick when they leave their home over an extended period of time places like homes can trigger self-reflection thoughts about who someone is or used to be or who they might become these types of reflections also occur in places where there is a collective historical identity such as gettysburg or ground zero
popular sayings include a man's home is his castle there is no place like home home sweet home to be at home home away from home make yourself at home you can never go home again home is where the heart is and home is where you hang your hat
the word home can be used for various types of residential community institutions in which people can live such as nursing retirement homes for seniors foster homes etc short-term accommodation in a treatment facility for several weeks is unlikely to be considered home
homes may be lost in many ways such as natural disasters or wars
