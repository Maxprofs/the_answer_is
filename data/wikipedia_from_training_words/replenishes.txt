watercress is an aquatic plant species with the botanical name nasturtium officinale this should not be confused with the quite different group of plants with the common name of nasturtium botanical name tropaeolum
watercress is a rapidly growing aquatic or semi-aquatic perennial plant native to europe and asia and one of the oldest known leaf vegetables consumed by humans it is currently a member of the family brassicaceae botanically related to garden cress mustard radish and wasabiall noteworthy for their piquant flavor
the hollow stems of watercress are floating and the leaves are pinnately compound small white and green flowers are produced in clusters and are frequently visited by insects especially hoverflies such as eristalis flies

watercress is also listed in some sources as belonging to the genus rorippa although molecular evidence shows the aquatic species with hollow stems are more closely related to cardamine than rorippa despite the latin name watercress is not particularly closely related to the flowers popularly known as nasturtiums (tropaeolum majus) t majus belongs to the family tropaeolaceae a sister taxon to the brassicaceae within the order brassicales
== cultivationedit ==
cultivation of watercress is practical on both a large-scale and a garden-scale being semi-aquatic watercress is well-suited to hydroponic cultivation thriving best in water that is slightly alkaline it is frequently produced around the headwaters of chalk streams in many local markets the demand for hydroponically grown watercress exceeds supply partly because cress leaves are unsuitable for distribution in dried form and can only be stored fresh for a short period
watercress can be sold in supermarkets in sealed plastic bags containing a little moisture and lightly pressurised to prevent crushing of contents this has allowed national availability with a once-purchased storage life of one to two days in chilled/refrigerated storage
also sold as sprouts the edible shoots are harvested days after germination if unharvested watercress can grow to a height of 50 to 120 centimetres (1 124 ft) like many plants in this family the foliage of watercress becomes bitter when the plants begin producing flowers
