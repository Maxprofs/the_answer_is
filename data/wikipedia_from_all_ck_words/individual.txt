an individual is a person or a specific object individuality (or selfhood) is the state or quality of being an individual particularly of being a person separate from other persons and possessing his or her own needs or goals the exact definition of an individual is important in the fields of biology law and philosophy
from the 15th century and earlier (and also today within the fields of statistics and metaphysics) individual meant indivisible typically describing any numerically singular thing but sometimes meaning a person from the 17th century on individual indicates separateness as in individualism
== in law ==
an individual de facto lawfully defined usually refers to a natural person as opposed to a legal person (which could be a corporation) it can also possibly be a person or a specific object if otherwise defined
== philosophical views of the individual human ==
=== empiricism ===
early empiricists such as ibn tufail in early 12th century islamic spain and john locke in late 17th century england introduced the idea of the individual as a tabula rasa ("blank slate") shaped from birth by experience and education this ties into the idea of the liberty and rights of the individual society as a social contract between rational individuals and the beginnings of individualism as a doctrine
=== hegel ===
hegel regarded history as the gradual evolution of mind as it tests its own concepts against the external world each time the mind applies its concepts to the world the concept is revealed to be only partly true within a certain context thus the mind continually revises these incomplete concepts so as to reflect a fuller reality (commonly known as the process of thesis antithesis and synthesis) the individual comes to rise above his or her own particular viewpoint and grasps that he or she is a part of a greater whole insofar as he or she is bound to family a social context and/or a political order
=== existentialism ===
with the rise of existentialism kierkegaard rejected hegel's notion of the individual as subordinated to the forces of history instead he elevated the individual's subjectivity and capacity to choose his or her own fate later existentialists built upon this notion nietzsche for example examines the individual's need to define his/her own self and circumstances in his concept of the will to power and the heroic ideal of the bermensch the individual is also central to sartre's philosophy which emphasizes individual authenticity responsibility and free will in both sartre and nietzsche (and in nikolai berdyaev) the individual is called upon to create his or her own values rather than rely on external socially imposed codes of morality
=== buddhism ===
in buddhism the concept of the individual lies in anatman or no-self. according to anatman the individual is really a series of interconnected processes that working together give the appearance of being a single separated whole in this way anatman together with anicca resembles a kind of bundle theory instead of an atomic indivisible self distinct from reality (see subject-object problem) the individual in buddhism is understood as an interrelated part of an ever-changing impermanent universe (see interdependence nondualism reciprocity)
=== objectivism ===
ayn rand's objectivism regards every human as an independent sovereign entity who possesses an inalienable right to his or her own life a right derived from his or her nature as a rational being individualism and objectivism hold that a civilized society or any form of association cooperation or peaceful coexistence among humans can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of individual rights and that a group as such has no rights other than the individual rights of its members the principle of individual rights is the only moral base of all groups or associations since only an individual man or woman can possess rights the expression individual rights is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of clarification in todays intellectual chaos) but the expression collective rights is a contradiction in terms individual rights are not subject to a public vote a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual)
== biology ==
in biology the question of what is an individual is related to the question of what is an organism which is an important question in biology and philosophy of biology but there has been little explicit work devoted to the biological notion of an individual an individual organism is not the only kind of individual that is considered as a unit of selection genes genomes or groups may function as individual units
asexual reproduction occurs in some colonial organisms so that the individuals are genetically identical such a colony is called a genet and an individual in such a population is referred to as a ramet the colony rather than the individual functions as a unit of selection in other colonial organisms the individuals may be closely related to one another but differ as a result of sexual reproduction
