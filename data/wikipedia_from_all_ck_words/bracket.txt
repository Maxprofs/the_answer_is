a bracket is a tall punctuation mark typically used in matched pairs within text to set apart or interject other text used unqualified brackets refer to different types of brackets in different parts of the world and in different contexts
brackets include round brackets/parentheses square brackets curly brackets angle brackets and various other pairs of symbols
in addition to referring to the class of all types of brackets the unqualified word bracket is most commonly used to refer to a specific type of bracket in modern american usage this is usually the square bracket and in modern british usage this is usually the parenthesis
== history ==
chevrons (< >) were the earliest type of bracket to appear in written english desiderius erasmus coined the term lunula to refer to the rounded parentheses () recalling the shape of the crescent moon

== typography ==
the characters and  known as guillemets or angular quote brackets are actually quotation mark glyphs used in several european languages which one of each pair is the opening quote mark and which is the closing quote varies between languages
in english typographers generally prefer to not set brackets in italics even when the enclosed text is italic however in other language like german if brackets enclose text in italics they are usually set in italics too
== types and uses ==
=== parentheses ===
parentheses /prnsiz/ (singular parenthesis /prnss/) (also called simply brackets or round brackets curved brackets oval brackets or colloquially parens /prnz/) contain material that serves to clarify or is aside from the main point a milder effect may be obtained by using a pair of commas as the delimiter though if the sentence contains commas for other purposes visual confusion may result
in american usage parentheses are usually considered separate from other brackets and calling them brackets is unusual
parentheses may be used in formal writing to add supplementary information such as sen john mccain (r-arizona) spoke at length they can also indicate shorthand for either singular or plural for nounse.g. the claim(s)"or for either masculine or feminine in some languages with grammatical gender
parenthetical phrases have been used extensively in informal writing and stream of consciousness literature examples include the southern american author william faulkner (see absalom absalom and the quentin section of the sound and the fury) as well as poet e e cummings
parentheses have historically been used where the dash is currently usedthat is in order to depict alternatives such as parenthesis)(parentheses examples of this usage can be seen in editions of fowler's
parentheses may be nested (generally with one set (such as this) inside another set) this is not commonly used in formal writing (though sometimes other brackets [especially square brackets] will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses [in other words secondary {or even tertiary} phrases can be found within the main parenthetical sentence])
any punctuation inside parentheses or other brackets is independent of the rest of the text mrs pennyfarthing (what yes that was her name!) was my landlady. in this usage the explanatory text in the parentheses is a parenthesis (parenthesized text is usually short and within a single sentence where several sentences of supplemental material are used in parentheses the final full stop would be within the parentheses or simply omitted again the parenthesis implies that the meaning and flow of the text is supplemental to the rest of the text and the whole would be unchanged were the parenthesized sentences removed.)
parentheses are included in the syntaxes of many computer programming languages typically needed to denote an argument to tell the compiler what data type the method/function needs to look for first in order to initialise in some cases such as in lisp parentheses are a fundamental construct of the language
parentheses in mathematics signify a different precedence of operators for example 2 + 3 4 equals 14 since the multiplication is done before the addition however (2 + 3) 4 equals 20 because the parentheses override normal precedence causing the addition to be done first some authors follow the convention in mathematical equations that when parentheses have one level of nesting the inner pair are parentheses and the outer pair are square brackets example
a related convention is that when parentheses have two levels of nesting curly brackets (braces) are the outermost pair following this convention when more than three levels of nesting are needed often a cycle of parentheses square brackets and curly brackets will continue this helps to distinguish between one such level and the next
parentheses are also used to set apart the arguments in mathematical functions for example f(x) is the function f applied to the variable x in coordinate systems parentheses are used to denote a set of coordinates so in the cartesian coordinate system (4,7) may represent the point located at 4 on the x-axis and 7 on the y-axis parentheses may also represent intervals (0 5) for example is the interval between 0 and 5 not including 0 or 5
parentheses may also be used to represent a binomial coefficient and in chemistry to denote a polyatomic ion
in chinese and japanese  a combination of brackets and parentheses called and sumitsuki are used for inference in chinese and used in titles and headings in japanese
unpaired parenthesis
lowercase latin letters used as indexes rather than bullets or numbers followed by unpaired parenthesis are used in ordered lists especially in
a) educational testing
b) technical writing and diagrams
c) market research and
d) elections
in more formal usage parenthesis may refer to the entire bracketed text not just to the punctuation marks used (so all the text in this set of round brackets may be said to be a parenthesis a parenthetical or a parenthetical phrase")
=== square brackets ===
square bracketsalso called crotchets or simply brackets (us)are mainly used to insert explanatory material or to mark where a passage was omitted from an original material by someone other than the original author or to mark modifications in quotations
a bracketed ellipsis [] is often used to indicate omitted material i'd like to thank [several unimportant people] for their tolerance... bracketed comments inserted into a quote indicate when the original has been modified for clarity i appreciate it [the honor] but i must refuse and the future of psionics [see definition] is in doubt or one can quote the original statement i hate to do laundry with a modification inserted in the middle of it he hate[s] to do laundry
additionally a small letter can be replaced by a capital one when the beginning of the original text is omitted for succinctness for example when referring to a verbose original to the extent that policymakers and elite opinion in general have made use of economic analysis at all they have as the saying goes done so the way a drunkard uses a lamppost for support not illumination it can be quoted succinctly as [p]olicymakers (...) made use of economic analysis (...) the way a drunkard uses a lamppost for support not illumination. when nested parentheses are needed brackets are used as a substitute for the inner pair of parentheses within the outer pair when deeper levels of nesting are needed convention is to alternate between parentheses and brackets at each level
alternatively empty square brackets can also indicate omitted material usually single letter only the original reading is also a process and it also changes you. can be rewritten in a quote as it has been suggested that reading can also change[] you
the bracketed expression [sic] is used after a quote or reprinted text to indicate the passage appears exactly as in the original source where it may otherwise appear that a mistake has been made in reproduction
in translated works brackets are used to signify the same word or phrase in the original language to avoid ambiguity for example he is trained in the way of the open hand [karate]
in linguistics phonetic transcriptions are generally enclosed within brackets often using the international phonetic alphabet whereas phonemic transcriptions typically use paired slashes pipes (| |) are often used to indicate a morphophonemic rather than phonemic representation other conventions are double slashes (// //) double pipes (|| ||) and curly brackets ({ }) in lexicography square brackets usually surround the section of a dictionary entry which contains the etymology of the word the entry defines
brackets (called move-left symbols or move right symbols) are added to the sides of text in proofreading to indicate changes in indentation
brackets are used to denote parts of the text that need to be checked when preparing drafts prior to finalizing a document they often denote points that have not yet been agreed to in legal drafts and the year in which a report was made for certain case law decisions
brackets are used in mathematics in a variety of notations including standard notations for intervals commutators the floor function the lie bracket the iverson bracket and matrices
brackets can also be used in chemistry to represent the concentration of a chemical substance or to denote distributed charge in a complex ion
brackets are used in many computer programming languages especially those derived or inspired by the c language to indicate array indexing operators in this context the opening bracket is often pronounced as sub indicating a subscript
=== curly brackets ===
curly bracketsalso called braces or (colloquially) squiggly brackets in the usare used in specialized ways in poetry and music (to mark repeats or joined lines) the musical terms for this mark joining staves are accolade and brace and connect two or more lines of music that are played simultaneously in mathematics they delimit sets and in writing they may be used similarly select your animal {goat sheep cow horse} and follow me in many programming languages they enclose groups of statements such languages (c being one of the best-known examples) are therefore called curly bracket languages
presumably due to the similarity of the words brace and bracket (although they do not share an etymology) many people mistakenlytreat brace as a synonym for bracket therefore when it is necessary to avoid any possibility of confusion such as in computer programming it may be best to use the term curly bracket rather than brace however general usage in north american english favours the latter form indian programmers often use the name flower bracket
in classical mechanics curly brackets are often also used to denote the poisson bracket between two quantities
=== angle brackets ===
chevrons are often used to enclose highlighted material
in physical sciences chevrons are used to denote an average over time or over another continuous parameter for example
the inner product of two vectors is commonly written as  but the notation (a b) is also used
in mathematical physics especially quantum mechanics it is common to write the inner product between elements as  as a short version of  or  where is an operator this is known as dirac notation or bra-ket notation
in set theory chevrons or parentheses are used to denote ordered pairs and other tuples whereas curly brackets are used for unordered sets
in linguistics chevrons indicate graphemes (i.e. written letters) or orthography as in the english word /kt/ is spelled cat.
in epigraphy they may be used for mechanical transliterations of a text into the latin script
in textual criticism and hence in many editions of pre-modern works chevrons denote sections of the text which are illegible or otherwise lost the editor will often insert his own reconstruction where possible within them
chevrons are infrequently used to denote words that are thought instead of spoken such as
what an unusual flower
the mathematical or logical symbols for greater-than (>) and less-than (<) are inequality symbols and are not punctuation marks when so used nevertheless true chevrons are not available on a typical computer keyboard but the less-than and greater-than symbols are so they are often substituted they are loosely referred to as angled brackets or chevrons in this case
single and double pairs of comparison operators (<< >>) (meaning much smaller than and much greater than) are sometimes used instead of guillemets ( ) (used as quotation marks in many languages) when the proper characters are not available
in comic books chevrons are often used to mark dialogue that has been translated notionally from another language in other words if a character is speaking another language instead of writing in the other language and providing a translation one writes the translated text within chevrons of course since no foreign language is actually written this is only notionally translated
chevron-like symbols are part of standard chinese and korean punctuation where they generally enclose the titles of books and or and for traditional vertical printing and and or and for horizontal printing see also non-english usage of quotation marks
in continuum mechanics chevrons may be used as macaulay brackets
in east asian punctuation angle brackets are used as quotation marks
=== floor and ceiling corners ===
the floor corner brackets and  the ceiling corner brackets and are used to denote the integer floor and ceiling functions
=== quine corners and half brackets ===
the quine corners and have at least two uses in mathematical logic either as quasi-quotation a generalization of quotation marks or to denote the gdel number of the enclosed expression
half brackets are used in english to mark added text such as in translations bill saw her
in editions of papyrological texts half brackets and or and  enclose text which is lacking in the papyrus due to damage but can be restored by virtue of another source such as an ancient quotation of the text transmitted by the papyrus for example callimachus iambus 1.2 reads  a hole in the papyrus has obliterated  but these letters are supplied by an ancient commentary on the poem second intermittent sources can be between and  quine corners are sometimes used instead of half brackets
=== double brackets ===
double brackets (or white square brackets)  are used to indicate the semantic evaluation function in formal semantics for natural language and denotational semantics for programming languages the brackets stand for a function that maps a linguistic expression to its denotation or semantic value
=== brackets with quills ===
known as mouse parentheses (swedish piggparenteser) and are used in swedish dictionaries
== specific uses ==
=== computing ===
the various bracket characters are frequently used in many computer languages as operators or for other syntax markup
=== mathematics ===
in addition to the use of parentheses to specify the order of operations both parentheses and brackets are used to denote an interval also referred to as a half-open range the notation [a,c) is used to indicate an interval from a to c that is inclusive of a but exclusive of c that is [5,12) would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12 including 5 but not 12 the numbers may come as close as they like to 12 including 11.999 and so forth (with any finite number of 9s) but 12.0 is not included in some european countries the notation [5,12[ is also used for this the endpoint adjoining the bracket is known as closed whereas the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as open if both types of brackets are the same the entire interval may be referred to as closed or open as appropriate whenever + or is used as an endpoint it is normally considered open and adjoined to a parenthesis see interval (mathematics) for a more complete treatment
in quantum mechanics chevrons are also used as part of dirac's formalism braket notation to note vectors from the dual spaces of the bra a| and the ket |b mathematicians will also commonly write a,b for the inner product of two vectors in statistical mechanics chevrons denote ensemble or time average chevrons are used in group theory to write group presentations and to denote the subgroup generated by a collection of elements note that obtuse angled chevrons are not always (and even not by all users) distinguished from a pair of less-than and greater-than signs <> which are sometimes used as a typographic approximation of chevrons
in group theory and ring theory brackets denote the commutator in group theory the commutator [g,h] is commonly defined as g1h1gh in ring theory the commutator [a,b] is defined as ab ba furthermore in ring theory braces denote the anticommutator where {a,b} is defined as ab + ba the bracket is also used to denote the lie derivative or more generally the lie bracket in any lie algebra
various notations like the vinculum have a similar effect to brackets in specifying order of operations or otherwise grouping several characters together for a common purpose
in the z formal specification language braces define a set and chevrons define a sequence
=== accounting ===
traditionally in accounting negative amounts are placed in parentheses
=== law ===
brackets are used in some countries in the citation of law reports to identify parallel citations to non-official reporters for example chronicle pub co v superior court (1998) 54 cal.2d 548 [7 cal.rptr 109] in some other countries (such as england and wales) square brackets are used to indicate that the year is part of the citation and parentheses are used to indicate the year the judgment was given for example national coal board v england [1954] ac 403 is in the 1954 volume of the appeal cases reports although the decision may have been given in 1953 or earlier whereas (1954) 98 sol jo 176 reports a decision from 1954 in volume 98 of the solicitor's journal which may be published in 1955 or later
when quoted material is in any way altered the alterations are enclosed in brackets within the quotation for example plaintiff asserts his cause is just stating [m]y causes is [sic] just. although in the original quoted sentence the word my was capitalized it has been modified in the quotation and the change signalled with brackets similarly where the quotation contained a grammatical error the quoting author signalled that the error was in the original with [sic] (latin for thus') (california style manual section 4:59 (4th ed.))
=== sports ===
tournament brackets the diagrammatic representation of the series of games played during a tournament usually leading to a single winner are so named for their resemblance to brackets or braces
== encoding in digital media ==
representations of various kinds of brackets in ascii unicode and html are given below
^ a b c d &lang and &rang were tied to the deprecated symbols u+2329 and u+232a in html4 and mathml2 but are being migrated to u+27e8 and u+27e9 for html5 and mathml3 as defined in xml entity definitions for characters
braces (curly brackets) first became part of a character set with the 8-bit code of the ibm 7030 stretch
the angle brackets or chevrons at u+27e8 and u+27e9 are for mathematical use and western languages whereas u+3008 and u+3009 are for east asian languages the chevrons at u+2329 and u+232a are deprecated in favour of the u+3008 and u+3009 east asian angle brackets unicode discourages their use for mathematics and in western texts because they are canonically equivalent to the cjk code points u+300x and thus likely to render as double-width symbols the less-than and greater-than symbols are often used as replacements for chevrons
