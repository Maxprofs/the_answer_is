geese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe anserini of the family anatidae this tribe comprises the genera anser (the grey geese) branta (the black geese) and chen (the white geese) a number of other birds mostly related to the shelducks have goose as part of their names more distantly related members of the family anatidae are swans most of which are larger than true geese and ducks which are smaller
== etymology ==
the word goose is a direct descendent of proto-indo-european root *ghans- in germanic languages the root gave old english gs with the plural gs and gandres (becoming modern english goose geese gander and gosling respectively) frisian goes gies and guoske new high german gans gnse and ganter and old norse gs this term also gave lithuanian ss irish g (goose from old irish giss) latin anser greek /khn dutch gans albanian gat (heron) sanskrit hamsa and hamsi finnish hanhi avestan z polish g russian  czech husa and persian ghz
the term goose applies to the female in particular while gander applies to the male in particular young birds before fledging are called goslings the collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle when in flight they are called a skein a team or a wedge when flying close together they are called a plump
== true geese ==
the three living genera of true geese are anser grey geese including the greylag goose and domestic geese chen white geese (often included in anser) and branta black geese such as the canada goose
two genera of geese are only tentatively placed in the anserinae they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own cereopsis the cape barren goose and cnemiornis the prehistoric new zealand goose either these or more probably the goose-like coscoroba swan is the closest living relative of the true geese
fossils of true geese are hard to assign to genus all that can be said is that their fossil record particularly in north america is dense and comprehensively documents many different species of true geese that have been around since about 10 million years ago in the miocene the aptly named anser atavus (meaning great-great-great-grandfather goose") from some 12 million years ago had even more plesiomorphies in common with swans in addition some goose-like birds are known from subfossil remains found on the hawaiian islands
geese are monogamous living in permanent pairs throughout the year however unlike most other permanently monogamous animals they are territorial only during the short nesting season paired geese are more dominant and feed more two factors that result in more young
== other birds called geese ==
a number of mainly southern hemisphere birds are called geese most of which belong to the shelduck subfamily tadorninae these are
orinoco goose neochen jubata
egyptian goose alopochen aegyptiacus
the south american sheldgeese genus chloephaga
the prehistoric madagascar sheldgoose centrornis majori
the spur-winged goose plectropterus gambensis is most closely related to the shelducks but distinct enough to warrant its own subfamily the plectropterinae
the blue-winged goose cyanochen cyanopterus and the cape barren goose cereopsis novaehollandiae have disputed affinities they belong to separate ancient lineages that may ally either to the tadorninae anserinae or closer to the dabbling ducks (anatinae)
the three species of small waterfowl in the genus nettapus are named pygmy geese they seem to represent another ancient lineage with possible affinities to the cape barren goose or the spur-winged goose
a genus of prehistorically extinct seaducks chendytes is sometimes called diving-geese due to their large size
the unusual magpie goose is in a family of its own the anseranatidae
the northern gannet a seabird is also known as the solan goose although it is a bird unrelated to the true geese or any other anseriformes for that matter
