alternative periodic tables tabulations chemical elements differing significantly organization traditional depiction periodic system several devised often purely didactic reasons correlations chemical elements effectively captured standard periodic table
alternative periodic tables developed often highlight emphasize different chemical physical properties elements apparent traditional periodic tables tables aim emphasize nucleon electronic structure atoms done changing spatial relationship representation element respect another element table tables aim emphasize chemical element isolations humans time
