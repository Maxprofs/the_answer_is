=== aristocratic titlesedit ===
prince/princess from the latin princeps meaning first person or first citizen. the title was originally used by augustus at the establishment of the roman empire to avoid the political risk of assuming the title rex ("king") in what was technically still a republic in modern times the title is often given to the sons and daughters of ruling monarchs also a title of certain ruling monarchs under the holy roman empire and its subsidiary territories until 1918 (still survives in liechtenstein and also in monaco although that is elsewhere) and in imperial russia before 1917 the german title is frst ("first") is a translation of the latin term the equivalent russian term is (knyaz)
archduke/archduchess a title derived from the greek archon ("ruler higher") and the latin dux("leader") it was used most notably by the habsburg dynasty that ruled austria and hungary until 1918
grand duke/grand duchess big large + latin dux (leader) a variant of archduke, used particularly in english translations romanov dynasty russian titles also used in various germanic territories until world war i still survives in luxembourg
duke (the feminine equivalent is duchess) from the latin dux a military title used in the roman empire especially in its early byzantine period when it designated the military commander for a specific zone
marquis or marquess (the feminine equivalent is marquise or marchioness) from the french marchis literally ruler of a border area, (from old french marche meaning border") exact english translation is march lord, or lord of the march.
count (the feminine equivalent is countess) from the latin comes meaning companion. the word was used by the roman empire in its byzantine period as an honorific with a meaning roughly equivalent to modern english peer. it became the title of those who commanded field armies in the empire as opposed to dux which commanded locally based forces
earl (used in the united kingdom instead of count but the feminine equivalent is countess) from the germanic jarl meaning chieftain, the title was brought to the british isles by the anglo-saxons and survives in use only there having been superseded in scandinavia and on the european continent
viscount (feminine equivalent is viscountess) from the latin vicarius (deputy substitute hence vicar and prefix vice-") appended to latin comes literally deputy count
baron (the feminine equivalent is baroness) from the late latin baro meaning man servant soldier the title originally designated the chief feudal tenant of a place who was in vassalage to a greater lord
in the united kingdom lord and lady are used as titles for members of the nobility unlike titles such as mr and mrs they are not used before first names except in certain circumstances for example as courtesy titles for younger sons etc. of peers
lord from old english hlford hlfweard meaning literally bread-keeper, from hlf (bread) + weard (guardian keeper) and by extension husband father or chief (from which comes modified titles such as first sea lord and lord of the manor.) the feminine equivalent is lady from the related old english hlfde meaning literally bread-kneader from hlf (bread) + de (maid) and by extension wife daughter or mistress of the house (from which comes first lady the anachronistic second lady etc.)
emperor/empress - from the latin imperator meaning he/she who holds the authority to command (imperium)
king/queen - derived from old norse/germanic words the original meaning of the root of king apparently meant leader of the family or descendant of the leader of the family, and the original meaning of queen, wife. by the time the words came into english they already meant ruler.
tsar/tsarina (tsaritsa) - slavonic loan-word from latin caesar the name of julius caesar taken by his heir augustus and thereafter by augustus successors as roman emperor through the fall of constantinople in 1453 germanic loan-word for caesar is kaiser
leader from old english ldan meaning to guide derived from old norse and germanic the head of state of north korea is titled great leader the de facto head of state of iran is titled supreme leader
popess
the title of a character found in tarot cards based upon the pope on the roman catholic church as the bishop of rome is an office always forbidden to women there is no formal feminine of pope which comes from the latin word papa (an affectionate form of the latin for father) indeed the oxford english dictionary does not contain the word
the mythical pope joan who was reportedly a woman is always referred to with the masculine title pope even when her female identity is known further even if a woman were to become bishop of rome it is unclear if she would take the title popess a parallel might be drawn with the anglican communion whose female clergy use the masculine titles of priest and bishop as opposed to priestess or bishopess
nonetheless some european languages along with english have formed a feminine form of the word pope such as the italian papessa the french papesse and the german ppstin
