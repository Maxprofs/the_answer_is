== decline ==
maeda retired from active duty in 1998 leaving tamura as the top star but the collapse of uwf international and the subsequent rise of the pride provided competition that proved to be too much for the promotion on february 15 2002 the promotion ceased activity
japanese rings stars who made transitions into puroresu since then include nagai masayuki naruse wataru sakata and hiroyuki ito whereas the promotion zst was founded in november 2002 to accommodate former rings fighters
== revival ==
