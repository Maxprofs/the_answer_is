the term worm /wrm/ is used in everyday language to describe many different distantly related animals that typically have a long cylindrical tube-like body and no limbs worms vary in size from microscopic to over 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length for marine polychaete worms (bristle worms) 6.7 metres (22 ft) for the african giant earthworm microchaetus and 58 metres (190 ft) for the marine nemertean worm (bootlace worm) lineus longissimus various types of worm occupy a small variety of parasitic niches living inside the bodies of other animals free-living worm species do not live on land but instead live in marine or freshwater environments or underground by burrowing
in biology worm refers to an obsolete taxon (vermes) used by carolus linnaeus and jean-baptiste lamarck for all non-arthropod invertebrate animals and stems from the old english word wyrm most animals called worms are invertebrates but the term is also used for the amphibian caecilians and the slow worm anguis a legless burrowing lizard invertebrate animals commonly called worms include annelids (earthworms) nematodes (roundworms) platyhelminthes (flatworms) marine polychaete worms (bristle worms) marine nemertean worms ("bootlace worms") marine chaetognatha (arrow worms) priapulid worms and insect larvae such as grubs and maggots
worms may also be called helminths particularly in medical terminology when referring to parasitic worms especially the nematoda (roundworms) and cestoda (tapeworms) which reside in the intestines of their host when an animal or human is said to have worms it means that it is infested with parasitic worms typically roundworms or tapeworms
== distribution and habitatedit ==
worms live in almost all parts of the world including marine freshwater and terrestrial habitats some worms living in the ground help to condition the soil (e.g. annelids aschelminths) many thrive as parasites of plants (e.g. aschelminths) and animals including humans (e.g. platyhelminths aschelminths) several other worms may be free-living or non parasitic there are worms that live in freshwater seawater and even on the seashore ecologically worms form an important link in the food chains in virtually all the ecosystems of the world
in the united states the average population of worms per acre is 53,767
northern forests in america were once worm free
== classificationedit ==
in everyday language the term worm is also applied to various other living forms such as larvae insects centipedes shipworms (teredo worms) or even some vertebrates (creatures with a backbone) such as blindworms and caecilians worms can be divided into several groups but are still technically decomposers
the first of these platyhelminthes includes the flatworms tapeworms and flukes they have a flat ribbon- or leaf-shaped body with a pair of eyes at the front some are parasites
the second group contains the threadworms roundworms and hookworms this phylum is called nematoda threadworms may be microscopic such as the vinegar eelworm or more than 1 metre (3 feet) long they are found in damp earth moss decaying substances fresh water or salt water some roundworms are also parasites the guinea worm for example gets under the skin of the feet and legs of people living in tropical countries
the third group consists of the segmented worms with bodies divided into segments or rings this phylum is called annelida among these are the earthworms and the bristle worms of the sea
in earlier taxonomic classification all the above were included in the now obsolete group vermes
there are hundreds of thousands of species that live in a wide variety of habitats other than soil over time this broad definition narrowed to the modern definition although this still includes several different animal groups
to most people the most familiar worms are the earthworms members of phylum annelida earthworms in general have been around for 120 million years they enrich and aerate the soil charles darwin found that worms turn over the top six inches (15 cm) of topsoil every 20 years in a field near where he lived in less favourable conditions such as waterlogged soils or hard soil deficient in suitable organic matter or in seasonally dry soils they cannot achieve anything like that they lack a brain in the sense of the vertebrate brain but have nerve centers (called ganglia) they also lack eyes but can sense light with photoreceptors worms are hermaphrodites (both sexes in one animal) but can cross fertilize
other invertebrate groups may be called worms especially colloquially in particular many unrelated insect larvae are called worms such as the railroad worm woodworm glowworm bloodworm inchworm mealworm silkworm and wooly bear worm
worms may also be called helminths particularly in medical terminology when referring to parasitic worms especially the nematoda (roundworms) and cestoda (tapeworms) hence helminthology is the study of parasitic worms when a human or an animal such as a dog or horse is said to have worms it means that it is infested with parasitic worms typically roundworms or tapeworms deworming is a method to kill off the worms that have infected a human or animal by giving anthelmintic drugs
ringworm is not a worm at all but a skin fungus
== characteristicsedit ==
some species of earthworms have a tongue-like lobe above the mouth called prostomium the prostomium is actually a sensory device earthworms do not have a nose eyes ears or hands to gather sensory information about their environment instead they depend on their prostomium and sensory receptors in their skin to feel their way through the soil worms usually have a cylindrical flattened or leaf-like body shape and are often without any true limbs or appendages instead they may have bristles or fins that help them move a few have light-sensing organs worms vary in size from less than 1 mm (0.04 inch) in certain aschelminths to more than 30 m (100 feet) in certain ribbon worms recently researchers have found electromagnetic sensor in the worm's brain worms use it to detect earth's magnetic field and facilitate the underground navigation
some worms reproduce sexually hermaphroditism the condition in which a single individual possesses both male and female reproductive parts is common in many groups of worms asexual reproduction whereby new individuals develop from the body cells of another also occurs in some worms
worm species differ in their abilities to move about on their own many species have bodies with no major muscles and cannot move on their ownthey must be moved by forces or other animals in their environment many other species have bodies with major muscles and can move on their own they are a type of muscular hydrostat many species of worms are decomposers they break down dead plants and animals to return nutrients to the soil they have also been known to infiltrate households feeding on food in the early stages of decomposition namely breads and cheeses
earthworms are divided into three different categories the first are the surface dwellers the epigeic worms then there are the upper soil worms the endogeic worms finally there are the deep burrowing species the anecic
== society and cultureedit ==
historically english-speaking cultures have used the (now deprecated) terms worm wurm or wyrm to describe carnivorous reptiles ("serpents") and the related mythical beasts dragons
the term worm can also be used as an insult or pejorative term used towards people to describe a cowardly or weak individual or individual seen as pitiable
== imagery in the artsedit ==
worms are sometimes used as a metaphor of putrefaction or corruption a corpse may be said to be fed to the worms
