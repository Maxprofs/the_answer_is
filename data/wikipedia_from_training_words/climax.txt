since the first european contact was made in 1513 by spanish explorer juan ponce de len who named it la florida ([la floia] the flowery") upon landing there in the easter season pascua florida florida was a challenge for the european colonial powers before it gained statehood in the united states in 1845 it was a principal location of the seminole wars against the native americans and racial segregation after the american civil war
today florida is distinctive for its large cuban expatriate community and high population growth as well as for its increasing environmental issues the state's economy relies mainly on tourism agriculture and transportation which developed in the late 19th century florida is also renown for amusement parks orange crops the kennedy space center and as a popular destination for retirees

== history ==
by the 16th century the earliest time for which there is a historical record major native american groups included the apalachee (of the florida panhandle) the timucua (of northern and central florida) the ais (of the central atlantic coast) the tocobaga (of the tampa bay area) the calusa (of southwest florida) and the tequesta (of the southeastern coast)
=== european arrival ===
florida was the first part of the continental united states to be visited by europeans the earliest known european explorers came with the spanish conquistador juan ponce de len de len spotted the peninsula on april 2 1513 and he named the region la florida ("flowery land") the story that he was searching for the fountain of youth is a myth
by may 1539 conquistador hernando de soto skirted the coast of florida searching for a deep harbor to land he described seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile some reaching as high as 70 feet (21 m) with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult very soon many smokes appeared along the whole coast, billowing against the sky when the native ancestors of the seminole spotted the newcomers and spread the alarm by signal fires the spanish introduced christianity cattle horses sheep the spanish language and more to florida both the spanish and french established settlements in florida with varying degrees of success in 1559 don tristn de luna y arellano established a colony at present-day pensacola one of the first european settlements in the continental united states but it was abandoned by 1561
in 1565 the spanish colony of st augustine (san agustn) was established spain maintained tenuous control over the region by converting the local tribes to christianity the area of spanish florida diminished with the establishment of english colonies to the north and french colonies to the west the english attacked st augustine burning the city and its cathedral to the ground several times until spain built the castillo de san marcos (in 1672) and fort matanzas (in 1742) to defend it
florida attracted numerous africans and african americans from adjacent british colonies in north america who sought freedom from slavery the spanish crown gave them freedom and those freedmen settled north of st augustine in gracia real de santa teresa de mose the first free black settlement of its kind in what became the united states
in 1763 spain traded florida to the kingdom of great britain for control of havana cuba which had been captured by the british during the seven years war it was part of a large expansion of british territory following the country's victory in the seven years war almost the entire spanish population left taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to cuba the british soon constructed the king's road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british named cow ford both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there
the british divided florida into the two colonies of british east florida and british west florida the british government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the french and indian war in order to encourage settlement in order to induce settlers to move to the two new colonies reports of the natural wealth of florida were published in england a large number of british colonists who were energetic and of good character moved to florida mostly coming from south carolina georgia and england though there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of bermuda this would be the first permanent english-speaking population in what is now duval county baker county st johns county and nassau county the british built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber
as a result of these initiatives northeastern florida prospered economically in a way it never did under spanish rule furthermore the british governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the floridas and in the meantime they were with the advice of councils to establish courts this would be the first introduction of much of the english-derived legal system which florida still has today including trial-by-jury habeas corpus and county-based government neither east florida nor west florida would send any representatives to philadelphia to draft the declaration of independence florida would remain a loyalist stronghold for the duration of the american revolution
spain received both floridas after britain's defeat by the american colonies and the subsequent treaty of versailles in 1783 continuing the division into east and west florida
=== joining the united states indian removal ===
spanish presence was minor during spain's second governance period the region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base for indian attacks against the u.s. and the u.s demanded spain reform
americans of english descent and americans of scots-irish descent began moving into northern florida from the backwoods of georgia and south carolina though technically not allowed by the spanish authorities the spanish were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the united states would continue to migrate into florida unchecked these migrants mixing with the already present british settlers who had remained in florida since the british period would be the progenitors of the population known as florida crackers
these american settlers established a permanent foothold in the area and ignored spanish officials the british settlers who had remained also resented spanish rule leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called free and independent republic of west florida on september 23 after meetings beginning in june rebels overcame the spanish garrison at baton rouge (now in louisiana) and unfurled the flag of the new republic a single white star on a blue field this flag would later become known as the bonnie blue flag
in 1810 parts of west florida were annexed by proclamation of president james madison who claimed the region as part of the louisiana purchase these parts were incorporated into the newly formed territory of orleans the u.s annexed the mobile district of west florida to the mississippi territory in 1812 spain continued to dispute the area though the united states gradually increased the area it occupied
seminole indians based in east florida began raiding georgia settlements and offering havens for runaway slaves the united states army led increasingly frequent incursions into spanish territory including the 18171818 campaign against the seminole indians by andrew jackson that became known as the first seminole war the united states now effectively controlled east florida control was necessary according to secretary of state john quincy adams because florida had become a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy civilized or savage of the united states and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.
florida had become a burden to spain which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons madrid therefore decided to cede the territory to the united states through the adams-ons treaty which took effect in 1821 president james monroe was authorized on march 3 1821 to take possession of east florida and west florida for the united states and provide for initial governance andrew jackson served as military governor of the newly acquired territory but only for a brief period on march 30 1822 the united states merged east florida and part of west florida into the florida territory
by the early 1800s indian removal was a significant issue throughout the southeastern u.s and also in florida in 1830 the u.s congress passed the indian removal act and as settlement increased pressure grew on the united states government to remove the indians from florida seminoles harbored runaway blacks known as the black seminoles and clashes between whites and indians grew with the influx of new settlers in 1832 the treaty of payne's landing promised to the seminoles lands west of the mississippi river if they agreed to leave florida many seminole left at this time
some seminoles remained and the u.s army arrived in florida leading to the second seminole war (183542) following the war approximately 3,000 seminole and 800 black seminole were removed to indian territory a few hundred seminole remained in florida in the everglades
on march 3 1845 florida became the 27th state to join the united states of america the state was admitted as a slave state although initially its population grew slowly
as european-american settlers continued to encroach on seminole lands and the united states intervened to move the remaining seminoles to the west the third seminole war (185558) resulted in the forced removal of most of the remaining seminoles although hundreds of seminole indians remained in the everglades
=== slavery civil war and disenfranchisement ===
white settlers began to establish cotton plantations in florida which required numerous laborers which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market by 1860 florida had only 140,424 people of whom 44% were enslaved there were fewer than 1,000 free african americans before the civil war
in january 1861 florida declared its secession from the union and became a founding member of the confederate states the confederates received little help from florida the 15,000 men it offered were generally sent elsewhere the largest engagements in the state were the battle of olustee on february 20 1864 and the battle of natural bridge on march 6 1865 both were confederate victories the war ended in 1865
following the civil war florida's congressional representation was restored on june 25 1868 after the reconstruction period ended in 1876 white democrats regained power in the state legislature in 1885 they created a new constitution followed by statutes through 1889 that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites
until the mid-20th century florida was the least populous southern state in 1900 its population was only 528,542 of whom nearly 44% were african american the same proportion as before the civil war the boll weevil devastated cotton crops
forty thousand blacks roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population left the state in the great migration they left due to lynchings and racial violence and for better opportunities disfranchisement for most african americans in the state persisted until the civil rights movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage
=== 20th century growth ===
historically florida's economy was based upon agricultural products such as cattle farming sugarcane citrus tomatoes and strawberries
economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to florida and related development of hotels and resort communities combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the florida land boom of the 1920s which brought a brief period of intense land development devastating hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 followed by the great depression brought that period to a halt florida's economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for world war ii
the climate tempered by the growing availability of air conditioning and low cost of living made the state a haven migration from the rust belt and the northeast sharply increased florida's population after the war in recent decades more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy
with a population of more than 18 million according to the 2010 census florida is the most populous state in the southeastern united states and the fourth most populous in the united states
== geography ==
much of the state of florida is situated on a peninsula between the gulf of mexico the atlantic ocean and the straits of florida spanning two time zones it extends to the northwest into a panhandle extending along the northern gulf of mexico it is bordered on the north by the states of georgia and alabama and on the west at the end of the panhandle by alabama
florida is near several caribbean countries particularly the bahamas and cuba florida is one of the largest states east of the mississippi river and only alaska and michigan are larger in water area the water boundary is 3 nautical miles (3.5 mi 5.6 km) offshore in the atlantic ocean and 9 nautical miles (10 mi 17 km) offshore in the gulf of mexico

the florida panther is close to extinction a record 23 were killed in 2009 predominately by automobile collisions leaving about 100 individuals in the wild the center for biological diversity and others have therefore called for a special protected area for the panther to be established manatees are also dying at a rate higher than their reproduction
much of florida has an elevation of less than 12 feet (3.7 m) including many populated areas therefore it is susceptible to rising sea levels associated with global warming the atlantic beaches that are vital to the state's economy are being washed out to sea due to rising sea levels caused by climate change the miami beach area close to the continental shelf is running out of accessible offshore sand reserves

in 1998 democratic voters were most dominant in areas of the state with a high percentage of racial minorities as well as transplanted white liberals who primarily came from the northeastern united states south florida and the miami metropolitan area was a good example as it had a particularly high level of both racial minorities and white liberals because of this the area has voted as one of the most democratic areas of the state the daytona beach area has been to a lesser extent somewhat similar to south florida demographically and the city of orlando had a large hispanic population which often favored democrats republicans remain dominant throughout much of the rest of florida particularly in the more rural and suburban areas as is the case throughout the deep south
the fast-growing i-4 corridor area which runs through central florida and connects the cities of daytona beach orlando and tampa/st petersburg had a fairly similar number of both republican and democratic voters the area is often seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion of the state and the liberal southern portion making it the biggest swing area in the state in recent times whichever way the i-4 corridor area containing 40% of florida voters votes has often determined who will win the state of florida in presidential elections
