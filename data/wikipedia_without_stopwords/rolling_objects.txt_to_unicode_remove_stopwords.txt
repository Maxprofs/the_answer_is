rolling type motion combines rotation commonly axially symmetric object translation object respect surface either one moves ideal conditions exist two contact without sliding
rolling sliding referred pure rolling definition sliding instantaneous velocity rolling object points contacts surface surface particular reference plane rolling surface rest instantaneous velocity point contact rolling object zero
practice due small deformations near contact area sliding energy dissipation occurs nevertheless resulting rolling resistance much lower sliding friction thus rolling objects typically require much less energy moved sliding ones result objects easily move experience force component along surface instance gravity tilted surface wind pushing pulling torque engine unlike axially symmetrical objects rolling motion cone rolling flat surface center gravity performs circular motion rather linear motion rolling objects necessarily axiallysymmetrical two well known nonaxiallysymmetrical rollers reuleaux triangle meissner bodies oloid sphericon members special family developable rollers develop entire surface rolling flat plane objects corners dice roll successive rotations edge corner contact surface
applications
land vehicles use wheels therefore rolling displacement slip kept minimum approximating pure rolling otherwise loss control accident may result may happen road covered snow sand oil taking turn high speed attempting brake accelerate suddenly
one practical applications rolling objects use rollingelement bearings ball bearings rotating devices made metal rolling elements usually encased two rings rotate independently mechanisms inner ring attached stationary shaft axle thus inner ring stationary outer ring free move little friction basis almost motors found ceiling fans cars drills etc rely operate amount friction mechanisms parts depends quality ball bearings much lubrication mechanism
rolling objects also frequently used tools transportation one basic ways placing usually flat object series linedup rollers wheels object wheels moved along straight line long wheels continuously replaced front see history bearings method primitive transportation efficient machinery available today practical application objects wheels cars trains human transportation vehicles

trajectory point trochoid particular trajectory point object axis line trajectory point object rim cycloid
velocity point rolling object given displacement particle rolling objects contact point line surface angular velocity vector thus despite rolling different rotation around fixed axis instantaneous velocity particles rolling object rotating around axis passes point contact angular velocity
point rolling object farther axis point contact temporarily move opposite direction overall motion level rolling surface example point part flange train wheel rail
energy
since kinetic energy entirely function object mass velocity result may used parallel axis theorem obtain kinetic energy associated simple rolling
forces acceleration
differentiating relation linear angular velocity respect time gives formula relating linear angular acceleration applying newtons second law
follows accelerate object net force torque required external force torque acts rolling objectsurface system tangential force point contact surface rolling object provides required torque long motion pure rolling force usually static friction example road wheel bowling lane bowling ball static friction isnt enough friction becomes dynamic friction slipping happens tangential force opposite direction external force therefore partially cancels resulting net force acceleration
dimension mass mass would rotational inertia distance axis rotation therefore term may thought mass linear inertia equivalent rolling object rotational inertia around center mass action external force upon object simple rotation may conceptualized accelerating sum real mass virtual mass represents rotational inertia since work done external force split overcoming translational rotational inertia external force results smaller net force dimensionless multiplicative factor represents ratio aforesaid virtual mass object actual mass equal radius gyration corresponding object rotational inertia pure rotation rotational inertia pure rolling square power due fact rotational inertia point mass varies proportionally square distance axis
specific case object rolling inclined plane experiences static friction normal force weight air drag absent acceleration direction rolling slope
specific object shape mass distribution depends scale density however vary object made roll different radiuses instance varies train wheel set rolling normally tire axle follows given reference rolling object another object bigger different density roll acceleration behavior object free fall object sliding without friction instead rolling incline plane
