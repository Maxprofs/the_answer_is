prenectarian period lunar geologic timescale runs million years ago time initial formation moon million years ago nectaris basin formed large impact followed nectarian period
description
prenectarian rocks rare lunar sample suite mostly composed lunar highlands material heavily churned brecciated thermally affected subsequent impacts particularly late heavy bombardment marks approximate beginning nectarian period primary prenectarian lunar highland material dominated rock type anorthosite suggests early stage lunar crustal formation occurred via mineral crystallization global magma ocean
