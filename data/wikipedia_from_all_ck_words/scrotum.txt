the scrotum is an anatomical male reproductive structure that consists of a suspended sack of skin and smooth muscle that is dual-chambered present in most terrestrial male mammals and located under the penis one testis is typically lower than the other which functions to avoid compression in the event of impact the perineal raphe is a small vertical slightly raised ridge of scrotal skin under which scrotal septum exists it appears as a thin longitudinal line that runs front to back over the entire scrotum the scrotum contains the external spermatic fascia testes epididymis ductus deferens it is a distention of the perineum and carries some abdominal tissues into its cavity including the testicular artery testicular vein and pampinform plexus in humans and some other mammals the scrotum becomes covered with pubic hair at puberty
the scrotum is biologically homologous to the labia majora in females although present in most mammals the external scrotum is absent in stream-lined marine mammals such as whales and seals as well as in some lineages of land mammals such as the afrotherians xenarthrans and numerous families of bats rodents and insectivores

the skin on the scrotum is more highly pigmented compared to the rest of the body the septum is a connective tissue membrane dividing the scrotum into two cavities

=== genital homology between sexesedit ===
male sex hormones are secreted by the testes later in embryonic life to cause the development of secondary sex organs the scrotum is developmentally homologous to the labia minora and labia majora the raphe does not exist in females reproductive organs and tissues develop in females and males begin during the fifth week after fertilization the gonadal ridge grows behind the peritoneal membrane by the sixth week string-like tissues called primary sex cords form within the enlarging gonadal ridge externally a swelling called the genital tubercule appears over the cloacal membrane
up until the eighth week after fertilization the reproductive organs do not appear to be different between the male and female and are called in-differentiated testosterone secretion starts during week eight reaches peak levels during week 13 and eventually declines to very low levels by the end of the second trimester the testosterone causes the masculinization of the labioscrotal folds into the scrotum the scrotal raphe is formed when the embryonic urethral groove closes by week 12
=== asymmetryedit ===
one testis is typically lower than the other which functions to avoid compression in the event of impact in humans the left testis is typically lower than the right
=== scrotal growth and pubertyedit ===
though the testes and scrotum form early in embryonic life sexual maturation begins upon entering puberty the increased secretion of testosterone causes the darkening of the skin and development of pubic hair on the scrotum
== internal structureedit ==
additional tissues and organs reside inside the scrotum and are described in more detail in the following articles
== functionedit ==
the scrotum regulates the temperature of the testes and maintains it at 35 degrees celsius (95 degrees fahrenheit) i.e two degrees below the body temperature of 37 degrees celsius (98.6 degrees fahrenheit) higher temperatures affect spermatogenesis temperature control is accomplished by the smooth muscles of the scrotum moving the testicles either closer to or further away from the abdomen dependent upon the ambient temperature this is accomplished by the cremaster muscle in the abdomen and the dartos fascia (muscular tissue under the skin)
having the scrotum and testicles situated outside the abdominal cavity may provide additional advantages the external scrotum is not affected by abdominal pressure this may prevent the emptying of the testes before the sperm were matured sufficiently for fertilization another advantage is it protects the testes from jolts and compressions associated with an active lifestyle animals that have stately movements such as elephants whales and marsupial moles have internal testes and no scrotum
== clinical significanceedit ==
a study has indicated that use of a laptop computer positioned on the lap can negatively affect sperm production
== diseases and conditionsedit ==
the scrotum and its contents can develop diseases or incur injuries these include
