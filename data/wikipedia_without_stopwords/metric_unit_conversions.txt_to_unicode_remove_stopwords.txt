si prefixed forms metreedit
si prefixes often employed denote decimal multiples submultiples metre shown table indicated table commonly used others long distances usually expressed km astronomical units gm lightyears pm parsecs pm rather mm gm tm pm em zm ym cm m m common dm dam hm respectively
terms micron occasionally millimicron often used instead micrometre m nanometre nm practice officially discouraged
equivalents unitsedit
within table inch yard mean international inch international yard respectively though approximate conversions lefthand column hold international survey units
means approximately equal
means equal definition exactly equal
one metre exactly equivalent inches yards
simple mnemonic aid exists assist conversion three
metre nearly equivalent feet inches gives overestimate mm however practice memorising conversion formulas discouraged favour practice visualisation metric units
