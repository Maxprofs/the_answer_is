== content summary ==
not in front of the children is a history of censorship from ancient greece ancient rome and the middle ages to the present heins examines the comstock laws promulgated by anthony comstock in 1873 which criminalized the mailing of writings deemed immoral examples of censored works include james joyce's ulysses d h lawrence's lady chatterley's lover and comedian george carlin's seven dirty words monologue the author discusses the meese report by the attorney general's commission on pornography the report acquired its colloquial name because the panel was selected by u.s attorney general edwin meese released in 1986 the report decried pornography's alleged harm to women and children contemporary censorship issues detailed in the book include howard stern and the columbine high school massacre and the author critiques a return to modesty discovering the lost virtue by wendy shalit and mothers organized for moral stability (moms) the author discusses censorship aimed at youth in u.s legislation including the children's internet protection act and communications decency act
heins examines the question of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material she believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is based on the idea that minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents she writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating first-amendment rights guaranteed to adults heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view
the author believes that determinations of what should be censored from whom should not be made by the government stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship she writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the internet
not in front of the children explores the development of u.s case law with different standards of censorship for children and adults the author describes a 1968 supreme court of the united states case ginsberg v new york where the court upheld a law preventing minors from viewing sexually explicit media sam ginsberg and his wife managed a diner in bellmore new york a mother sent her 16-year-old son to buy two adult magazines at the diner creating a situation where ginsberg would be prosecuted ginsberg was convicted of violating a new york state law which forbade selling magazines with pictures of nude women to minors
the u.s supreme court upheld ginsberg's conviction ruling that the new york state legislature was not required to prove a tangible negative impact on youth from exposure to sexually explicit material the court said the new york state legislature only needed to assume that such an impact existed justice william o douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in the case criticizing the new york law he concluded he knew individuals who fit the definition of juvenile delinquent but were fifty years old and extrapolated the impact of the decision could be expanded to affect adults and multiple organizations in society instead of just youths
heins demonstrates how lawmakers in other states used the ginsberg v new york ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children a year after the ruling an ohio court determined that ken kesey's novel one flew over the cuckoo's nest was inappropriate for youth the author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view pointing out that the belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship not in front of the children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself

david darts discussed not in front of the children in an article for studies in art education and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over time in the history of censorship he observed that the rationale for justifying censorship of artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from plato to contemporary times namely anxiety that youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate
