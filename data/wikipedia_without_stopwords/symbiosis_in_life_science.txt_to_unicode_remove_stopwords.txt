symbiosis greek together living close often longterm interaction two different biological species albert bernhard frank used word symbiosis previously used depict people living together community describe mutualistic relationship lichens german mycologist heinrich anton de bary defined living together unlike organisms
definition symbiosis varied among scientists believe symbiosis refer persistent mutualisms others believe apply type persistent biological interaction ie mutualistic commensalistic parasitic years debate current biology ecology textbooks use latter de bary definition even broader definition ie symbiosis species interactions restrictive definition longer used ie symbiosis mutualism
symbiotic relationships obligate meaning symbionts entirely depend survival example many lichens consist fungal photosynthetic symbionts cannot live others facultative meaning live organism
symbiotic relationships include associations one organism lives another ectosymbiosis mistletoe one partner lives inside endosymbiosis lactobacilli bacteria humans symbiodinium corals symbiosis also classified physical attachment organisms symbiosis organisms bodily union called conjunctive symbiosis symbiosis union called disjunctive symbiosis
physical interaction
endosymbiosis symbiotic relationship one symbiont lives within tissues either within cells extracellularly examples include diverse microbiomes rhizobia nitrogenfixing bacteria live root nodules legume roots actinomycete nitrogenfixing bacteria called frankia live alder tree root nodules singlecelled algae inside reefbuilding corals bacterial endosymbionts provide essential nutrients insects
ectosymbiosis also referred exosymbiosis symbiotic relationship symbiont lives body surface host including inner surface digestive tract ducts exocrine glands examples include ectoparasites lice commensal ectosymbionts barnacles attach jaw baleen whales mutualist ectosymbionts cleaner fish
mutualism
mutualism interspecies reciprocal altruism relationship individuals different species individuals benefit general lifelong interactions involving close physical biochemical contact properly considered symbiotic mutualistic relationships may either obligate species obligate one facultative facultative many biologists restrict definition symbiosis close mutualist relationships
large percentage herbivores mutualistic gut flora help digest plant matter difficult digest animal prey gut flora made cellulosedigesting protozoans bacteria living herbivores intestines coral reefs result mutualisms coral organisms various types algae live inside land plants land ecosystems rely mutualisms plants fix carbon air mycorrhyzal fungi help extracting water minerals ground
example mutual symbiosis relationship ocellaris clownfish dwell among tentacles ritteri sea anemones territorial fish protects anemone anemoneeating fish turn stinging tentacles anemone protect clownfish predators special mucus clownfish protects stinging tentacles
example goby fish sometimes lives together shrimp shrimp digs cleans burrow sand shrimp goby fish live shrimp almost blind leaving vulnerable predators outside burrow case danger goby fish touches shrimp tail warn happens shrimp goby fish quickly retreat burrow different species gobies elacatinus spp also exhibit mutualistic behavior cleaning ectoparasites fish
another nonobligate symbiosis known encrusting bryozoans hermit crabs live close relationship bryozoan colony acanthodesia commensale develops cirumrotatory growth offers crab pseudopagurus granulimanus helicospiraltubular extension living chamber initially situated within gastropod shell
one spectacular examples obligate mutualism siboglinid tube worms symbiotic bacteria live hydrothermal vents cold seeps worm digestive tract wholly reliant internal symbionts nutrition bacteria oxidize either hydrogen sulfide methane host supplies worms discovered late hydrothermal vents near galapagos islands since found deepsea hydrothermal vents cold seeps worlds oceans
also many types tropical subtropical ants evolved complex relationships certain tree species
mutualism endosymbiosis
mutualistic symbioses host cell lacks nutrients provided endosymbiont result host favors endosymbionts growth processes within producing specialized cells cells affect genetic composition host order regulate increasing population endosymbionts ensuring genetic changes passed onto offspring via vertical transmission heredity
adaptation endosymbiont hosts lifestyle leads many changes endosymbiontthe foremost drastic reduction genome size due many genes lost process metabolism dna repair recombination important genes participating dna rna transcription protein translation dnarna replication retained decrease genome size due loss protein coding genes due lessening intergenic regions open reading frame orf size thus species naturally evolving contain reduced sizes genes accounted increased number noticeable differences thereby leading changes evolutionary rates endosymbiotic bacteria related insects passed offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission intracellular bacteria goes many hurdles process resulting decrease effective population sizes compared free living bacteria incapability endosymbiotic bacteria reinstate wild type phenotype via recombination process called mullers ratchet phenomenon mullers ratchet phenomenon together less effective population sizes led accretion deleterious mutations nonessential genes intracellular bacteria could due lack selection mechanisms prevailing rich environment host
commensalism
commensalism describes relationship two living organisms one benefits significantly harmed helped derived english word commensal used human social interaction word derives medieval latin word formed com mensa meaning sharing table
commensal relationships may involve one organism using another transportation phoresy housing inquilinism may also involve one organism using something another created death metabiosis examples metabiosis hermit crabs using gastropod shells protect bodies spiders building webs plants
parasitism
parasitic relationship one one member association benefits harmed also known antagonistic antipathetic symbiosis parasitic symbioses take many forms endoparasites live within hosts body ectoparasites live surface addition parasites may necrotrophic say kill host biotrophic meaning rely hosts surviving biotrophic parasitism extremely successful mode life depending definition used many half animals least one parasitic phase life cycles also frequent plants fungi moreover almost freeliving animals host one parasite taxa example biotrophic relationship would tick feeding blood host
amensalism
amensalism type relationship exists one species inhibited completely obliterated one unaffected type symbiosis relatively uncommon rudimentary reference texts omnipresent natural world two types amensalism competition antibiosis competition larger stronger organisms deprives smaller weaker one resource antibiosis occurs one organism damaged killed another chemical secretion example competition sapling growing shadow mature tree mature tree begin rob sapling necessary sunlight mature tree large take rainwater deplete soil nutrients throughout process mature tree unaffected indeed sapling dies mature tree gains nutrients decaying sapling note nutrients become available saplings decomposition rather living sapling would case parasitism example antibiosis juglans nigra black walnut secreting juglone substance destroys many herbaceous plants within root zone
amensalism interaction organism inflicts harm another organism without costs benefits received clear case amensalism sheep cattle trample grass whilst presence grass causes negligible detrimental effects animals hoof grass suffers crushed amensalism often used describe strongly asymmetrical competitive interactions observed spanish ibex weevils genus timarcha feed upon type shrub whilst presence weevil almost influence food availability presence ibex enormous detrimental effect weevil numbers consume significant quantities plant matter incidentally ingest weevils upon
synnecrosis
synnecrosis rare type symbiosis interaction species detrimental organisms involved shortlived condition interaction eventually causes death evolution selects synnecrosis uncommon nature example relationship species bees victims bee sting species bees die stinging prey inflict pain albeit protect hive well victim term rarely used
symbiosis evolution
historically symbiosis received less attention interactions predation competition increasingly recognized important selective force behind evolution many species long history interdependent coevolution fact evolution eukaryotes plants animals fungi protists believed endosymbiotic theory resulted symbiosis various sorts bacteria theory supported certain organelles dividing independently cell observation organelles seem nucleic acid
vascular plants
vascular plants worldwide form symbiotic relationships fungi example arbuscular mycorrhizas
symbiogenesis
biologist lynn margulis famous work endosymbiosis contends symbiosis major driving force behind evolution considers darwins notion evolution driven competition incomplete claims evolution strongly based cooperation interaction mutual dependence among organisms according margulis dorion sagan life take globe combat networking
coevolution
symbiosis played major role coevolution flowering plants animals pollinate many plants pollinated insects bats birds highly specialized flowers modified promote pollination specific pollinator also correspondingly adapted first flowering plants fossil record relatively simple flowers adaptive speciation quickly gave rise many diverse groups plants time corresponding speciation occurred certain insect groups groups plants developed nectar large sticky pollen insects evolved specialized morphologies access collect rich food sources taxa plants insects relationship become dependent plant species pollinated one species insect
