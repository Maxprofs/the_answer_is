everyday usage mass object often referred weight though fact different concepts quantities scientific contexts mass refers loosely amount matter object though matter may difficult define whereas weight refers force experienced object due gravity words object mass kilogram weigh approximately newtons newton unit force kilogram unit mass surface earth mass multiplied gravitational field strength weight less mars gravity weaker saturn negligible space far significant source gravity always mass
objects surface earth weight although sometimes weight difficult measure example small object floating pool water even dish water appear weight since buoyed water found usual weight added water container entirely supported weighed scale thus weightless object floating water actually transfers weight bottom container pressure increases similarly balloon mass may appear weight even negative weight due buoyancy air however weight balloon gas inside merely transferred large area earths surface making weight difficult measure weight flying airplane similarly distributed ground disappear airplane level flight weightforce distributed surface earth plane runway spread larger area

weight object varies proportion strength gravitational field mass constant ignoring relativistic effects long energy matter added object accordingly astronaut spacewalk orbit freefall effort required hold communications satellite front weightless however since objects orbit retain mass inertia astronaut must exert ten times much force accelerate ton satellite rate one mass ton
