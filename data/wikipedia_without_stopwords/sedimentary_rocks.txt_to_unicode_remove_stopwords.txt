diagenesisedit
term diagenesis used describe chemical physical biological changes including cementation undergone sediment initial deposition exclusive surface weathering processes cause sediment consolidate compact solid substance forms loose material young sedimentary rocks especially quaternary age recent period geologic time scale often still unconsolidated sediment deposition builds overburden lithostatic pressure rises process known lithification takes place
sedimentary rocks often saturated seawater groundwater minerals dissolve minerals precipitate precipitating minerals reduce pore space rock process called cementation due decrease pore space original connate fluids expelled precipitated minerals form cement make rock compact competent way loose clasts sedimentary rock become glued together
sedimentation continues older rock layer becomes buried deeper result lithostatic pressure rock increases due weight overlying sediment causes compaction process grains mechanically reorganize compaction example important diagenetic process clay initially consist water compaction interstitial water pressed pore spaces compaction also result dissolution grains pressure solution dissolved material precipitates open pore spaces means net flow material pores however cases certain mineral dissolves precipitate process called leaching increases pore space rock
biochemical processes like activity bacteria affect minerals rock therefore seen part diagenesis fungi plants roots various organisms live beneath surface also influence diagenesis
burial rocks due ongoing sedimentation leads increased pressure temperature stimulates certain chemical reactions example reactions organic material becomes lignite coal temperature pressure increase still realm diagenesis makes way metamorphism process forms metamorphic rock

sedimentary rocks laid layers called beds strata bed defined layer rock uniform lithology texture beds form deposition layers sediment top sequence beds characterizes sedimentary rocks called bedding single beds couple centimetres several meters thick finer less pronounced layers called laminae structure forms rock called lamination laminae usually less centimetres thick though bedding lamination often originally horizontal nature always case environments beds deposited usually small angle sometimes multiple sets layers different orientations exist rock structure called crossbedding crossbedding forms smallscale erosion occurs deposition cutting part beds newer beds form angle older ones
opposite crossbedding parallel lamination sedimentary layering parallel laminations differences generally caused cyclic changes sediment supply caused example seasonal changes rainfall temperature biochemical activity laminae represent seasonal changes similar tree rings called varves sedimentary rock composed millimeter finer scale layers named general term laminite rocks lamination structural character called massive bedding
graded bedding structure beds smaller grain size occur top beds larger grains structure forms fast flowing water stops flowing larger heavier clasts suspension settle first smaller clasts though graded bedding form many different environments characteristic turbidity currents
bedform surface particular bed indicative particular sedimentary environment examples bed forms include dunes ripple marks sole markings tool marks flute casts groves dug sedimentary layer preserved often elongated structures used establish direction flow deposition
ripple marks also form flowing water two types asymmetric wave ripples symmetric current ripples environments current one direction rivers produce asymmetric ripples longer flank ripples oriented opposite direction current wave ripples occur environments currents occur directions tidal flats
