=== filmingedit ===
principal photography began in england on 5 august 1999 with oxfordshire bedfordshire and london standing in for early 19th century france oscar-winning production designer martin childs (shakespeare in love) imagined the primary location of charenton as an airy though circuitous place darkening as royer-collard takes over operations the screenplay specifies the way the inmates rooms link together which plays a key role in the relay of the marquis climactic story to madeleine screenwriter/playwright doug wright was a constant presence on set assisting the actors and producers in interpreting the script and bringing his vision to life
=== costumesedit ===
oscar-nominated costume designer jacqueline west created the intricate period costumes using each character as inspiration west previously worked with director philip kaufman on his crime drama rising sun for joaquin phoenix's abb costumers designed special pleather clogs to accommodate the actor's veganism in one scene rush's marquis de sade wears a suit decorated in bloody script which west described as challenging to make it features actual writings of de sade and costumers planned exactly where each sentence should go on the fabric before production began west gave winslet a copy of french painter lopold boilly's woman ironing to give her a feel for the character which winslet said greatly influenced her performance
=== castingedit ===
casting directors donna isaacson and priscilla john recruited a number of actors from a disabled actor's company to play the parts of many of the inmates at charenton
=== musicedit ===
the quills soundtrack was released by rca victor on 21 november 2000 featuring the music of oscar-winning composer stephen warbeck (shakespeare in love) featuring experimental instrumentation by the quills specialist band on such instruments as the serpent shawm and bucket most reviewers were intrigued by the unconventional and thematic score cinemusic.net reviewer ryan keaveney called the album a macabre masterpiece, with an addicting and mesmerizing sound urban cinephile contributor brad green described the album as a hedonistic pleasure that captures the spirit of an incorrigible perverse genius. soundtrack.net's glenn mcclanan disliked the lack of unifying unified themes and motifs that may have served each individual scene but made the film feel incoherent.
au clair de la lune
though not included on the soundtrack the opening notes of au clair de la lune a traditional french children's song recur throughout the film usually hummed by the marquis the song is originally sung by john hamway during the opening scene of a beheading which was filmed in oxford the english translation provides some illumination as to its selection as a theme for the marquis

=== critical receptionedit ===
reviews were generally positive with a 75% fresh rating at the review aggregate site rotten tomatoes and an average score of 70/100 at metacritic
elvis mitchell of the new york times complimented the euphoric stylishness of kaufman's direction and geoffrey rush's gleeful...flamboyant performance peter travers for rolling stone wrote about the exceptional actors particularly geoffrey rush's scandalously good performance as the marquis populating a film that is literate erotic and spoiling to be heard. stephanie zacharek of salon.com enthused over the delectable and ultimately terrifying fantasy of quills with rush as sun king, enriched by a luminous supporting cast
the film was not without its detractors including richard schickel of time magazine who decried director philip kaufman's approach as brutally horrific vulgarly unamusing, creating a film that succeeds only as soft-gore porn. eleanor ringel gillespie of the atlanta journal-constitution concurred finding quills shrill pretentious sophomoric and often just plain dumb. kenneth turan of the los angeles times dismissed the film as an overripe contrivance masquerading as high art while de sade biographer neil schaeffer in the guardian criticized the film for historical inaccuracies and for simplifying de sade's complex life (see below)
=== accoladesedit ===
quills received three oscar nominations at the 73rd annual academy awards for actor in a leading role (geoffrey rush previous winner for the 1996 movie shine) art direction (art martin childs sets jill quertier) and costume design (jacqueline west) the film was also nominated by the hollywood foreign press organizers of the golden globes for best actor in a drama (geoffrey rush) and best screenplay (douglas wright) the national board of review selected quills as its best film of 2000
== historical inaccuracyedit ==
neil schaeffer whose the marquis de sade a life was used by director philip kaufman as reference in a review published in the guardian criticized the film for historical inaccuracies and for simplifying de sade's complex life
schaeffer especially criticized the depiction of the de sade as a martyr to the oppression and censorship of church and state and the films sacrificing facts to a surreal and didactic conclusion that has no connection with the truth and is probably overwrought even as a twist of a fictional plot namely that the seemingly good people are all bad underneath are all hypocrites while the seemingly bad person de sade probably has some redeeming qualities
schaeffer detailed a number of disparities between fact and film
schaeffer relates that de sade's initial incarceration had nothing to do with his writing but with sexual scandals involving servants prostitutes and his sister-in-law he also criticized the opening scene's implication that the reign of terror caused the sanguinary streak of de sade's writing when his bloodiest and best work 120 days of sodom was written in the bastille - obviously before the revolution and not at charenton as suggested by the film in contrast to the film the historical de sade was not at the height of his literary career nor of his literary powers while at charenton nor did he cut the tall trim figure of the australian actor geoffrey rush but was of middling height and at the time of a considerable even a grotesque obesity
the manuscripts smuggled out of the asylum were not the novel justine which features prominently in the film but was published thirteen years before de sade's incarceration at the asylum de sade's smuggled works were not particularly outrageous mostly consisting of conventional novels and a number of plays he worked on throughout his life in hopes of having them performed most of these were soundly rejected by publishers de sade was in fact involved in the theater productions at charenton though none like the play featured in quills the plays performed were popular conventional parisian dramas the government shut the charenton theater down on 6 may 1813 years before the real dr royer-collard had any influence at charenton
schaeffer criticized also the film's treatment of de sade's personal relations regarding his wife (who had formally separated from him after the revolution) the chambermaid (who did not serve as a liaison to a publisher but with whom he had a sexual relationship from her early teens until shortly before his death) and his companion of many years who had a room at charenton (and actually smuggled out the manuscripts) but is ignored by the film furthermore de sade's hideous death in the movie is nothing like the truth for he died in his sleep in his 74th year as peacefully as any good christian
schaeffer argues that the main point of de sade's life and writing was not as movie-makers and reviewers alike seem to think [...] to oppose censorship but to push the limits - sexual spiritual and political - as a means of feeling out the limits of his times and of his own mind. schaeffer criticized that the film simplifies de sade into a modern victim and over-emphasises his potential as a focus for liberal-political meanings when in fact his life and perhaps his literary intentions - if you think of him as a satirist - can be seen as an object lesson warning against the excesses of cultural relativism and nihilism a very modern lesson it would seem.
schaeffer advised the viewer to distinguish between de sade and the protagonist of the film to see if quills is valid in its own terms let the viewer imagine it is about someone else let us say the marquis de newcastle and that the scene is bedlam and then see if the movie makes any sense.
