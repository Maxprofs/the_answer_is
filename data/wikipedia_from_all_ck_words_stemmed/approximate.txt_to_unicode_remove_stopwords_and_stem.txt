approxim anyth similar exact equal someth els term appli various properti eg valu quantiti imag descript near exact correct similar exact eg approxim time oclock
although approxim often appli number also frequent appli thing mathemat function shape physic law

ua also combin use indic equival approxim equival
uc also sometim use indic proport
ud also sometim use indic proport
u also use repres approach variabl limit
u use like japanes korean
