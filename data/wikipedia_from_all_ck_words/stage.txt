eagle is a common name for many large birds of prey of the family accipitridae it belongs to several groups of genera that are not necessarily closely related to each other
most of the 60 species of eagles are from eurasia and africa outside this area just 14 species can be found two in north america nine in central and south america and three in australia
== descriptionedit ==
eagles are large powerfully built birds of prey with a heavy head and beak even the smallest eagles like the booted eagle (aquila pennata) (which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (b jamaicensis)) have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings and more direct faster flight despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures the smallest species of eagle is the south nicobar serpent eagle (spilornis klossi) at 450 g (0.99 lb) and 40 cm (16 in) the largest species are discussed below like all birds of prey eagles have very large hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey strong muscular legs and powerful talons the beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey eagles eyes are extremely powerful having up to 3.6 times human acuity for the martial eagle which enables them to spot potential prey from a very long distance this keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light the female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male
eagles normally build their nests called eyries in tall trees or on high cliffs many species lay two eggs but the older larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched the dominant chick tends to be a female as they are bigger than the male the parents take no action to stop the killing
due to the size and power of many eagle species they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world the type of prey varies by genus the haliaeetus and ichthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish though the species in the former often capture various animals especially other water birds and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds the snake and serpent eagles of the genera circaetus terathopius and spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of africa and asia the eagles of the genus aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch where aquila eagles are absent other eagles such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of south america may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas many other eagles including the species-rich spizaetus genus live predominantly in woodlands and forest these eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense knotty environments hunting techniques differ among the species and genera with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based their environment and prey at any given time most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart
the bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird since one eagle flew with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule deer fawn however a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves such prey is too heavy to fly with thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg (66 lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker 78 times heavier than the preying eagle authors on birds david allen sibley pete dunne and clay sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other north american raptors)
they have at least one singular characteristic it has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter) predation is after all a two-edged sword all hawks seem to have this habit from the smallest kestrel to the largest ferruginous but not the eagles
among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey only the condors and some of the old world vultures are markedly larger it is regularly debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle they could be measured variously in total length body mass or wingspan different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species for example many forest-dwelling eagles including the very large harpy and philippine eagles have relatively short wingspans a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick short bursts through dense forested habitats eagles in the genus aquila though found almost strictly in open country are superlative soarers and have relatively long wings for their size
these lists of the top five eagles are based on weight length and wingspan respectively unless otherwise noted by reference the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide raptors of the world in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed

== groupsedit ==
eagles are often informally divided into four groups
the snake eagles are placed in the subfamily circaetinae the fish eagles booted eagles and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the buteoninae lerner & mindell proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of accipitridae
=== fish eaglesedit ===
sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets either fresh or as carrion
proposed subfamily haliaeetinae genera haliaeetus ichthyophaga
some authors include gypohierax angolensis the vulturine fish eagle (also called the palm-nut vulture) in this group however genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of neophrongypaetuseutriorchis (egyptian vulture bearded vulture (lammergeier) and madagascan serpent eagle)
the fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with haliastur and milvus the whole group is only distantly related to the buteo group
=== booted eaglesedit ===
booted eagles or true eagles have feathered tarsi (lower legs)
tribe aquililae or proposed subfamily aquilinae genera aquila hieraaetus spizaetus oroaetus spizastur nisaetus ictinaetus lophoaetus polemaetus and stephanoaetus
see comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these genera
=== snake eaglesedit ===
snake or serpent eagles are as the name suggests adapted to hunting reptiles
subfamily circaetinae genera circaetus spilornis dryotriorchis terathopius
eutriorchis (subfamily gypaetinae or circaetinae)
despite filling the niche of a snake eagle genetic studies suggest that the madagascan serpent eagle eutriorchis is not related
=== harpy eaglesedit ===
harpy eagles or giant forest eagles are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests the group contains two to six species depending on the author although these birds occupy similar niches and have traditionally been grouped together they are not all related the solitary eagles are related to the black-hawks and the philippine eagle to the snake eagles
harpy eagles (proposed subfamily harpiinae)
harpia harpyja harpy eagle central and south america
morphnus guianensis crested eagle central and south america
harpyopsis novaeguineae papuan eagle new guinea
philippine eagle
pithecophaga jefferyi philippine eagle philippines
solitary eagles
crowned eagle or crowned solitary eagle buteogallus (formerly harpyhaliaetus) coronatus south america
solitary eagle or montane solitary eagle buteogallus (formerly harpyhaliaetus) solitarius south america
== speciesedit ==
major new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera aquila and hieraaetus are not composed of nearest relatives and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place with some species being moved to lophaetus or ictinaetus
bonelli's eagle and the african hawk-eagle have been moved from hieraaetus to aquila
either the greater spotted eagle and lesser spotted eagle should move from aquila to join the long-crested eagle in lophaetus or perhaps better all three of these species should move to ictinaetus with the black eagle
the steppe eagle and tawny eagle once thought to be conspecific are not even each other's nearest relatives
