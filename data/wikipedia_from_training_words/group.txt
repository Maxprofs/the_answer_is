in mathematics a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements together with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element the operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms namely closure associativity identity and invertibility one of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation but the abstract formalization of the group axioms detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation applies much more widely it allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects the ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics
groups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of symmetry for example a symmetry group encodes symmetry features of a geometrical object the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other lie groups are the symmetry groups used in the standard model of particle physics point groups are used to help understand symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry and poincar groups can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity
the concept of a group arose from the study of polynomial equations starting with variste galois in the 1830s after contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870 modern group theoryan active mathematical disciplinestudies groups in their own right to explore groups mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller better-understandable pieces such as subgroups quotient groups and simple groups in addition to their abstract properties group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely (its group representations) both from a theoretical and a computational point of view a theory has been developed for finite groups which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups announced in 1983 since the mid-1980s geometric group theory which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects has become a particularly active area in group theory
== definition and illustrationedit ==
=== first example the integersedit ===
one of the most familiar groups is the set of integers z which consists of the numbers
 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4  together with addition
the following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the abstract group axioms given in the definition below
for any two integers a and b the sum a + b is also an integer thus adding two integers never yields some other type of number such as a fraction this property is known as closure under addition
for all integers a b and c (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) expressed in words adding a to b first and then adding the result to c gives the same final result as adding a to the sum of b and c a property known as associativity
if a is any integer then 0 + a = a + 0 = a zero is called the identity element of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer
for every integer a there is an integer b such that a + b = b + a = 0 the integer b is called the inverse element of the integer a and is denoted a
the integers together with the operation + form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects to appropriately understand these structures as a collective the following abstract definition is developed
=== definitionedit ===
a group is a set g together with an operation (called the group law of g) that combines any two elements a and b to form another element denoted a b or ab to qualify as a group the set and operation (g ) must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms
closure
for all a b in g the result of the operation a b is also in g
associativity
for all a b and c in g (a b) c = a (b c)
identity element
there exists an element e in g such that for every element a in g the equation e a = a e = a holds such an element is unique (see below) and thus one speaks of the identity element
inverse element
for each a in g there exists an element b in g such that a b = b a = e where e is the identity element
the result of an operation may depend on the order of the operands in other words the result of combining element a with element b need not yield the same result as combining element b with element a the equation
a b = b a
may not always be true this equation always holds in the group of integers under addition because a + b = b + a for any two integers (commutativity of addition) groups for which the commutativity equation a b = b a always holds are called abelian groups (in honor of niels abel) the symmetry group described in the following section is an example of a group that is not abelian
the identity element of a group g is often written as 1 or 1g a notation inherited from the multiplicative identity the identity element may also be written as 0 especially if the group operation is denoted by + in which case the group is called an additive group the identity element can also be written as id
the set g is called the underlying set of the group (g ) often the group's underlying set g is used as a short name for the group (g ) along the same lines shorthand expressions such as a subset of the group g or an element of group g are used when what is actually meant is a subset of the underlying set g of the group (g ) or an element of the underlying set g of the group (g ) usually it is clear from the context whether a symbol like g refers to a group or to an underlying set
=== second example a symmetry groupedit ===
two figures in the plane are congruent if one can be changed into the other using a combination of rotations reflections and translations any figure is congruent to itself however some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way and these extra congruences are called symmetries a square has eight symmetries these are
the identity operation leaving everything unchanged denoted id
rotations of the square around its center by 90 clockwise 180 clockwise and 270 clockwise denoted by r1 r2 and r3 respectively
reflections about the vertical and horizontal middle line (fh and fv) or through the two diagonals (fd and fc)
these symmetries are represented by functions each of these functions sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry for example r1 sends a point to its rotation 90 clockwise around the square's center and fh sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function these symmetries determine a group called the dihedral group of degree 4 and denoted d4 the underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions and the group operation is function composition two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions that is applying the first one to the square and the second one to the result of the first application the result of performing first a and then b is written symbolically from right to left as
b a ("apply the symmetry b after performing the symmetry a")
the right-to-left notation is the same notation that is used for composition of functions
the group table on the right lists the results of all such compositions possible for example rotating by 270 clockwise (r3) and then reflecting horizontally (fh) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (fd) using the above symbols highlighted in blue in the group table
fh r3 = fd
given this set of symmetries and the described operation the group axioms can be understood as follows
in contrast to the group of integers above where the order of the operation is irrelevant it does matter in d4 fh r1 = fc but r1 fh = fd in other words d4 is not abelian which makes the group structure more difficult than the integers introduced first
== historyedit ==
the modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics the original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4 the 19th-century french mathematician variste galois extending prior work of paolo ruffini and joseph-louis lagrange gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions) the elements of such a galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots at first galois ideas were rejected by his contemporaries and published only posthumously more general permutation groups were investigated in particular by augustin louis cauchy arthur cayley's on the theory of groups as depending on the symbolic equation n = 1 (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group
geometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically especially symmetry groups as part of felix klein's 1872 erlangen program after novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way further advancing these ideas sophus lie founded the study of lie groups in 1884
the third field contributing to group theory was number theory certain abelian group structures had been used implicitly in carl friedrich gauss number-theoretical work disquisitiones arithmeticae (1798) and more explicitly by leopold kronecker in 1847 ernst kummer made early attempts to prove fermat's last theorem by developing groups describing factorization into prime numbers
the convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with camille jordan's trait des substitutions et des quations algbriques (1870) walther von dyck (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an abstract group in the terminology of the time as of the 20th century groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of ferdinand georg frobenius and william burnside who worked on representation theory of finite groups richard brauer's modular representation theory and issai schur's papers the theory of lie groups and more generally locally compact groups was studied by hermann weyl lie cartan and many others its algebraic counterpart the theory of algebraic groups was first shaped by claude chevalley (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of armand borel and jacques tits
the university of chicago's 196061 group theory year brought together group theorists such as daniel gorenstein john g thompson and walter feit laying the foundation of a collaboration that with input from numerous other mathematicians classified all finite simple groups in 1982 this project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size in both length of proof and number of researchers research is ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification these days group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch impacting many other fields
== elementary consequences of the group axiomsedit ==
basic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under elementary group theory for example repeated applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of
a b c = (a b) c = a (b c)
generalizes to more than three factors because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms parentheses are usually omitted
the axioms may be weakened to assert only the existence of a left identity and left inverses both can be shown to be actually two-sided so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above
=== uniqueness of identity element and inversesedit ===
two important consequences of the group axioms are the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements there can be only one identity element in a group and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element thus it is customary to speak of the identity and the inverse of an element
to prove the uniqueness of an inverse element of a suppose that a has two inverses denoted b and c in a group (g ) then
the two extremal terms b and c are equal since they are connected by a chain of equalities in other words there is only one inverse element of a similarly to prove that the identity element of a group is unique assume g is a group with two identity elements e and f then e = e f = f hence e and f are equal
=== divisionedit ===
in groups the invertibility of the group action means that division is possible given elements a and b of the group g there is exactly one solution x in g to the equation x a = b in fact right multiplication of the equation by a1 gives the solution x = x a a1 = b a1 similarly there is exactly one solution y in g to the equation a y = b namely y = a1 b if the operation is commutative we get that x = y if not x may be different from y
a consequence of this is that multiplying by a group element g is a bijection specifically if g is an element of the group g there is a bijection from g to itself called left translation by g sending h g to g h similarly right translation by g is a bijection from g to itself sending h to h g if g is abelian left and right translation by a group element are the same
== basic conceptsedit ==
to understand groups beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulations as above more structural concepts have to be employed there is a conceptual principle underlying all of the following notions to take advantage of the structure offered by groups (which sets being structureless do not have) constructions related to groups have to be compatible with the group operation this compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways for example groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms by the mentioned principle they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense the structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient groups the principle of preserving structures"a recurring topic in mathematics throughoutis an instance of working in a category in this case the category of groups
=== group homomorphismsedit ===
group homomorphisms are functions that preserve group structure a function a g h between two groups (g ) and (h ) is called a homomorphism if the equation
a(g k) = a(g) a(k)
holds for all elements g k in g in other words the result is the same when performing the group operation after or before applying the map a this requirement ensures that a(1g) = 1h and also a(g)1 = a(g1) for all g in g thus a group homomorphism respects all the structure of g provided by the group axioms
two groups g and h are called isomorphic if there exist group homomorphisms a g h and b h g such that applying the two functions one after another in each of the two possible orders gives the identity functions of g and h that is a(b(h)) = h and b(a(g)) = g for any g in g and h in h from an abstract point of view isomorphic groups carry the same information for example proving that g g = 1g for some element g of g is equivalent to proving that a(g) a(g) = 1h because applying a to the first equality yields the second and applying b to the second gives back the first
=== subgroupsedit ===
informally a subgroup is a group h contained within a bigger one g concretely the identity element of g is contained in h and whenever h1 and h2 are in h then so are h1 h2 and h11 so the elements of h equipped with the group operation on g restricted to h indeed form a group
in the example above the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup r = {id r1 r2 r3} highlighted in red in the group table above any two rotations composed are still a rotation and a rotation can be undone by (i.e is inverse to) the complementary rotations 270 for 90 180 for 180 and 90 for 270 (note that rotation in the opposite direction is not defined) the subgroup test is a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset h of a group g to be a subgroup it is sufficient to check that g1h h for all elements g h h knowing the subgroups is important in understanding the group as a whole
given any subset s of a group g the subgroup generated by s consists of products of elements of s and their inverses it is the smallest subgroup of g containing s in the introductory example above the subgroup generated by r2 and fv consists of these two elements the identity element id and fh = fv r2 again this is a subgroup because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are in this particular case these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup
=== cosetsedit ===
in many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup for example in d4 above once a reflection is performed the square never gets back to the r2 configuration by just applying the rotation operations (and no further reflections) i.e the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed cosets are used to formalize this insight a subgroup h defines left and right cosets which can be thought of as translations of h by arbitrary group elements g in symbolic terms the left and right cosets of h containing g are
gh = {g h  h h} and hg = {h g  h h} respectively
the cosets of any subgroup h form a partition of g that is the union of all left cosets is equal to g and two left cosets are either equal or have an empty intersection the first case g1h = g2h happens precisely when g11 g2 h i.e if the two elements differ by an element of h similar considerations apply to the right cosets of h the left and right cosets of h may or may not be equal if they are i.e for all g in g gh = hg then h is said to be a normal subgroup
in d4 the introductory symmetry group the left cosets gr of the subgroup r consisting of the rotations are either equal to r if g is an element of r itself or otherwise equal to u = fcr = {fc fv fd fh} (highlighted in green) the subgroup r is also normal because fcr = u = rfc and similarly for any element other than fc (in fact in the case of d4 observe that all such cosets are equal such that fhr = fvr = fdr = fcr.)
=== quotient groupsedit ===
in some situations the set of cosets of a subgroup can be endowed with a group law giving a quotient group or factor group for this to be possible the subgroup has to be normal given any normal subgroup n the quotient group is defined by
g / n = {gn g g} g modulo n
this set inherits a group operation (sometimes called coset multiplication or coset addition) from the original group g (gn) (hn) = (gh)n for all g and h in g this definition is motivated by the idea (itself an instance of general structural considerations outlined above) that the map g g / n that associates to any element g its coset gn be a group homomorphism or by general abstract considerations called universal properties the coset en = n serves as the identity in this group and the inverse of gn in the quotient group is (gn)1 = (g1)n
the elements of the quotient group d4 / r are r itself which represents the identity and u = fvr the group operation on the quotient is shown at the right for example u u = fvr fvr = (fv fv)r = r both the subgroup r = {id r1 r2 r3} as well as the corresponding quotient are abelian whereas d4 is not abelian building bigger groups by smaller ones such as d4 from its subgroup r and the quotient d4 / r is abstracted by a notion called semidirect product
quotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its presentation any group is the quotient of the free group over the generators of the group quotiented by the subgroup of relations the dihedral group d4 for example can be generated by two elements r and f (for example r = r1 the right rotation and f = fv the vertical (or any other) reflection) which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses together with the relations
r 4 = f 2 = (r f)2 = 1
the group is completely described a presentation of a group can also be used to construct the cayley graph a device used to graphically capture discrete groups
sub- and quotient groups are related in the following way a subset h of g can be seen as an injective map h g i.e any element of the target has at most one element that maps to it the counterpart to injective maps are surjective maps (every element of the target is mapped onto) such as the canonical map g g / n interpreting subgroup and quotients in light of these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent to these definitions alluded to in the introduction in general homomorphisms are neither injective nor surjective kernel and image of group homomorphisms and the first isomorphism theorem address this phenomenon
== examples and applicationsedit ==
examples and applications of groups abound a starting point is the group z of integers with addition as group operation introduced above if instead of addition multiplication is considered one obtains multiplicative groups these groups are predecessors of important constructions in abstract algebra
groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups for example henri poincar founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group by means of this connection topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups for example elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops the second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point the blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant) because it can be continuously shrunk to a point the presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point the fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole) this way the fundamental group detects the hole
in more recent applications the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background in a similar vein geometric group theory employs geometric concepts for example in the study of hyperbolic groups further branches crucially applying groups include algebraic geometry and number theory
in addition to the above theoretical applications many practical applications of groups exist cryptography relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory in particular when implemented for finite groups applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics sciences such as physics chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept
=== numbersedit ===
many number systems such as the integers and the rationals enjoy a naturally given group structure in some cases such as with the rationals both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules vector spaces and algebras also form groups
==== integersedit ====
the group of integers z under addition denoted (z +) has been described above the integers with the operation of multiplication instead of addition (z ) do not form a group the closure associativity and identity axioms are satisfied but inverses do not exist for example a = 2 is an integer but the only solution to the equation a b = 1 in this case is b = 1/2 which is a rational number but not an integer hence not every element of z has a (multiplicative) inverse
==== rationalsedit ====
the desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering fractions
fractions of integers (with b nonzero) are known as rational numbers the set of all such fractions is commonly denoted q there is still a minor obstacle for (q ) the rationals with multiplication being a group because the rational number 0 does not have a multiplicative inverse (i.e. there is no x such that x 0 = 1) (q ) is still not a group
however the set of all nonzero rational numbers q {0} = {q q | q 0} does form an abelian group under multiplication denoted (q {0} ) associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers the closure requirement still holds true after removing zero because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero finally the inverse of a/b is b/a therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied
the rational numbers (including 0) also form a group under addition intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called rings andif division is possible such as in qfields which occupy a central position in abstract algebra group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities
=== modular arithmeticedit ===
in modular arithmetic two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the modulus the result of modular addition is the remainder of that division for any modulus n the set of integers from 0 to n 1 forms a group under modular addition the inverse of any element a is n a and 0 is the identity element this is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a clock if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours it ends up on 1 as shown at the right this is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 modulo 12 or in symbols
9 + 4 1 modulo 12
the group of integers modulo n is written zn or z/nz
for any prime number p there is also the multiplicative group of integers modulo p its elements are the integers 1 to p 1 the group operation is multiplication modulo p that is the usual product is divided by p and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication for example if p = 5 there are four group elements 1 2 3 4 in this group 4 4 = 1 because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1 which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1 for 5 divides 16 1 = 15 denoted
16 1 (mod 5)
the primality of p ensures that the product of two integers neither of which is divisible by p is not divisible by p either hence the indicated set of classes is closed under multiplication the identity element is 1 as usual for a multiplicative group and the associativity follows from the corresponding property of integers finally the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer a not divisible by p there exists an integer b such that
a b 1 (mod p) i.e p divides the difference a b 1
the inverse b can be found by using bzout's identity and the fact that the greatest common divisor gcd(a p) equals 1 in the case p = 5 above the inverse of 4 is 4 and the inverse of 3 is 2 as 3 2 = 6 1 (mod 5) hence all group axioms are fulfilled actually this example is similar to (q {0} ) above it consists of exactly those elements in z/pz that have a multiplicative inverse these groups are denoted fp they are crucial to public-key cryptography
=== cyclic groupsedit ===
a cyclic group is a group all of whose elements are powers of a particular element a in multiplicative notation the elements of the group are
 a3 a2 a1 a0 = e a a2 a3 
where a2 means a a and a3 stands for a1 a1 a1 = (a a a)1 etc such an element a is called a generator or a primitive element of the group in additive notation the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as
 aa a 0 a a+a 
in the groups z/nz introduced above the element 1 is primitive so these groups are cyclic indeed each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1 any cyclic group with n elements is isomorphic to this group a second example for cyclic groups is the group of n-th complex roots of unity given by complex numbers z satisfying zn = 1 these numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular n-gon as shown in blue at the right for n = 6 the group operation is multiplication of complex numbers in the picture multiplying with z corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation by 60 using some field theory the group fp can be shown to be cyclic for example if p = 5 3 is a generator since 31 = 3 32 = 9 4 33 2 and 34 1
some cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements in these groups for every non-zero element a all the powers of a are distinct despite the name cyclic group the powers of the elements do not cycle an infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to (z +) the group of integers under addition introduced above as these two prototypes are both abelian so is any cyclic group
the study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature including the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups and reflecting this state of affairs many group-related notions such as center and commutator describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian
=== symmetry groupsedit ===
symmetry groups are groups consisting of symmetries of given mathematical objectsbe they of geometric nature such as the introductory symmetry group of the square or of algebraic nature such as polynomial equations and their solutions conceptually group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects a group is said to act on another mathematical object x if every group element performs some operation on x compatibly to the group law in the rightmost example below an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones too) by a group action the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on
in chemical fields such as crystallography space groups and point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries these symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties for example group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved
not only are groups useful to assess the implications of symmetries in molecules but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry the jahn-teller effect is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states that are related to each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule
likewise group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition for example from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form an example is ferroelectric materials where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectic state accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition
such spontaneous symmetry breaking has found further application in elementary particle physics where its occurrence is related to the appearance of goldstone bosons
finite symmetry groups such as the mathieu groups are used in coding theory which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data and in cd players another application is differential galois theory which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory
=== general linear group and representation theoryedit ===
matrix groups consist of matrices together with matrix multiplication the general linear group gl(n r) consists of all invertible n-by-n matrices with real entries its subgroups are referred to as matrix groups or linear groups the dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a (very small) matrix group another important matrix group is the special orthogonal group so(n) it describes all possible rotations in n dimensions via euler angles rotation matrices are used in computer graphics
representation theory is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups it studies the group by its group actions on other spaces a broad class of group representations are linear representations i.e the group is acting on a vector space such as the three-dimensional euclidean space r3 a representation of g on an n-dimensional real vector space is simply a group homomorphism
 g gl(n r)
from the group to the general linear group this way the group operation which may be abstractly given translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations
given a group action this gives further means to study the object being acted on on the other hand it also yields information about the group group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups lie groups algebraic groups and topological groups especially (locally) compact groups
=== galois groupsedit ===
galois groups were developed to help solve polynomial equations by capturing their symmetry features for example the solutions of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are given by
exchanging + and  in the expression i.e permuting the two solutions of the equation can be viewed as a (very simple) group operation similar formulae are known for cubic and quartic equations but do not exist in general for degree 5 and higher abstract properties of galois groups associated with polynomials (in particular their solvability) give a criterion for polynomials that have all their solutions expressible by radicals i.e solutions expressible using solely addition multiplication and roots similar to the formula above
the problem can be dealt with by shifting to field theory and considering the splitting field of a polynomial modern galois theory generalizes the above type of galois groups to field extensions and establishesvia the fundamental theorem of galois theorya precise relationship between fields and groups underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics
== finite groupsedit ==
a group is called finite if it has a finite number of elements the number of elements is called the order of the group an important class is the symmetric groups sn the groups of permutations of n letters for example the symmetric group on 3 letters s3 is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters abc i.e contains the elements abc acb  up to cba in total 6 (or 3 factorial) elements this class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group sn for a suitable integer n (cayley's theorem) parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above s3 can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle
the order of an element a in a group g is the least positive integer n such that a n = e where a n represents
i.e application of the operation to n copies of a (if represents multiplication then an corresponds to the nth power of a.) in infinite groups such an n may not exist in which case the order of a is said to be infinity the order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element
more sophisticated counting techniques for example counting cosets yield more precise statements about finite groups lagrange's theorem states that for a finite group g the order of any finite subgroup h divides the order of g the sylow theorems give a partial converse
the dihedral group (discussed above) is a finite group of order 8 the order of r1 is 4 as is the order of the subgroup r it generates (see above) the order of the reflection elements fv etc is 2 both orders divide 8 as predicted by lagrange's theorem the groups fp above have order p 1
=== classification of finite simple groupsedit ===
mathematicians often strive for a complete classification (or list) of a mathematical notion in the context of finite groups this aim leads to difficult mathematics according to lagrange's theorem finite groups of order p a prime number are necessarily cyclic (abelian) groups zp groups of order p2 can also be shown to be abelian a statement which does not generalize to order p3 as the non-abelian group d4 of order 8 = 23 above shows computer algebra systems can be used to list small groups but there is no classification of all finite groups an intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups a nontrivial group is called simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself the jordanhlder theorem exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups listing all finite simple groups was a major achievement in contemporary group theory 1998 fields medal winner richard borcherds succeeded to prove the monstrous moonshine conjectures a surprising and deep relation of the largest finite simple sporadic groupthe monster group"with certain modular functions a piece of classical complex analysis and string theory a theory supposed to unify the description of many physical phenomena
== groups with additional structureedit ==
many groups are simultaneously groups and examples of other mathematical structures in the language of category theory they are group objects in a category meaning that they are objects (that is examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that mimic the group axioms for example every group (as defined above) is also a set so a group is a group object in the category of sets
=== topological groupsedit ===
some topological spaces may be endowed with a group law in order for the group law and the topology to interweave well the group operations must be continuous functions that is g h and g1 must not vary wildly if g and h vary only little such groups are called topological groups and they are the group objects in the category of topological spaces the most basic examples are the reals r under addition (r {0} ) and similarly with any other topological field such as the complex numbers or p-adic numbers all of these groups are locally compact so they have haar measures and can be studied via harmonic analysis the former offer an abstract formalism of invariant integrals invariance means in the case of real numbers for example
for any constant c matrix groups over these fields fall under this regime as do adele rings and adelic algebraic groups which are basic to number theory galois groups of infinite field extensions such as the absolute galois group can also be equipped with a topology the so-called krull topology which in turn is central to generalize the above sketched connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions an advanced generalization of this idea adapted to the needs of algebraic geometry is the tale fundamental group
=== lie groupsedit ===
lie groups (in honor of sophus lie) are groups which also have a manifold structure i.e they are spaces looking locally like some euclidean space of the appropriate dimension again the additional structure here the manifold structure has to be compatible i.e the maps corresponding to multiplication and the inverse have to be smooth
a standard example is the general linear group introduced above it is an open subset of the space of all n-by-n matrices because it is given by the inequality
det (a) 0
where a denotes an n-by-n matrix
lie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities rotation as well as translations in space and time are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics they can for instance be used to construct simple modelsimposing say axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description another example are the lorentz transformations which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other they can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of minkowski space the latter servesin the absence of significant gravitationas a model of space time in special relativity the full symmetry group of minkowski space i.e including translations is known as the poincar group by the above it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and by implication for quantum field theories symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory
== generalizationsedit ==
in abstract algebra more general structures are defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group for example if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated the resulting algebraic structure is called a monoid the natural numbers n (including 0) under addition form a monoid as do the nonzero integers under multiplication (z {0} ) see above there is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any (abelian) monoid much the same way as (q {0} ) is derived from (z {0} ) known as the grothendieck group groupoids are similar to groups except that the composition a b need not be defined for all a and b they arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry often in topological and analytical structures such as the fundamental groupoid or stacks finally it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary n-ary one (i.e an operation taking n arguments) with the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an n-ary group the table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups
