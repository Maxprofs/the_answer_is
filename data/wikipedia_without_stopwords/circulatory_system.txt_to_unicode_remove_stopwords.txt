structure
cardiovascular system
essential components human cardiovascular system heart blood blood vessels includes pulmonary circulation loop lungs blood oxygenated systemic circulation loop rest body provide oxygenated blood systemic circulation also seen function two partsa macrocirculation microcirculation average adult contains five six quarts roughly liters blood accounting approximately total body weight blood consists plasma red blood cells white blood cells platelets also digestive system works circulatory system provide nutrients system needs keep heart pumping
cardiovascular systems humans closed meaning blood never leaves network blood vessels contrast oxygen nutrients diffuse across blood vessel layers enter interstitial fluid carries oxygen nutrients target cells carbon dioxide wastes opposite direction component circulatory system lymphatic system open
arteries
oxygenated blood enters systemic circulation leaving left ventricle aortic semilunar valve first part systemic circulation aorta massive thickwalled artery aorta arches branches major arteries upper body passing diaphragm branches arteries supply lower parts body
capillaries
arteries branch small passages called arterioles capillaries capillaries merge bring blood venous system
veins
passage body tissues capillaries merge venules continue merge veins venous system finally coalesces two major veins superior vena cava roughly speaking draining areas heart inferior vena cava roughly speaking areas heart two great vessels empty right atrium heart
coronary vessels
heart supplied oxygen nutrients small loop systemic circulation
portal veins
general rule arteries heart branch capillaries collect veins leading back heart portal veins slight exception humans significant example hepatic portal vein combines capillaries around gut blood absorbs various products digestion rather leading directly back heart hepatic portal vein branches second capillary system liver
heart
heart pumps oxygenated blood body deoxygenated blood lungs human heart one atrium one ventricle circulation systemic pulmonary circulation four chambers total left atrium left ventricle right atrium right ventricle right atrium upper chamber right side heart blood returned right atrium deoxygenated poor oxygen passed right ventricle pumped pulmonary artery lungs reoxygenation removal carbon dioxide left atrium receives newly oxygenated blood lungs well pulmonary vein passed strong left ventricle pumped aorta different organs body
coronary circulation system provides blood supply heart muscle coronary circulation begins near origin aorta two arteries right coronary artery left coronary artery nourishing heart muscle blood returns coronary veins coronary sinus one right atrium back flow blood opening atrial systole prevented thebesian valve smallest cardiac veins drain directly heart chambers
pulmonary circulation
circulatory system lungs portion cardiovascular system oxygendepleted blood pumped away heart via pulmonary artery lungs returned oxygenated heart via pulmonary vein
oxygen deprived blood superior inferior vena cava enters right atrium heart flows tricuspid valve right atrioventricular valve right ventricle pumped pulmonary semilunar valve pulmonary artery lungs gas exchange occurs lungs whereby co released blood oxygen absorbed pulmonary vein returns oxygenrich blood left atrium
separate system known bronchial circulation supplies blood tissue larger airways lung
systemic circulation
systemic circulation circulation blood parts body except lungs systemic circulation portion cardiovascular system transports oxygenated blood away heart aorta left ventricle blood previously deposited pulmonary circulation rest body returns oxygendepleted blood back heart
brain
brain dual blood supply comes arteries front back called anterior posterior circulation respectively anterior circulation arises internal carotid arteries supplies front brain posterior circulation arises vertebral arteries supplies back brain brainstem circulation front back join together anastomise circle willis
kidneys
renal circulation receives around cardiac output branches abdominal aorta returns blood ascending vena cava blood supply kidneys contains many specialized blood vessels
lymphatic system
lymphatic system part circulatory system network lymphatic vessels lymph capillaries lymph nodes organs lymphatic tissues circulating lymph one major functions carry lymph draining returning interstitial fluid back towards heart return cardiovascular system emptying lymphatic ducts main function immune system
physiology
oxygen sample arterial blood healthy human breathing air sealevel pressure chemically combined hemoglobin molecules physically dissolved blood liquids connected hemoglobin hemoglobin molecule primary transporter oxygen mammals many species
development
development circulatory system starts vasculogenesis embryo human arterial venous systems develop different areas embryo arterial system develops mainly aortic arches six pairs arches develop upper part embryo venous system arises three bilateral veins weeks embryogenesis fetal circulation begins within th week development fetal circulation include lungs bypassed via truncus arteriosus birth fetus obtains oxygen nutrients mother placenta umbilical cord
arterial development
human arterial system originates aortic arches dorsal aortae starting week embryonic life first second aortic arches regress forms maxillary arteries stapedial arteries respectively arterial system arises aortic arches aortic arch completely regresses
dorsal aortae present dorsal side embryo initially present sides embryo later fuse form basis aorta approximately thirty smaller arteries branch back sides branches form intercostal arteries arteries arms legs lumbar arteries lateral sacral arteries branches sides aorta form definitive renal suprarenal gonadal arteries finally branches front aorta consist vitelline arteries umbilical arteries vitelline arteries form celiac superior inferior mesenteric arteries gastrointestinal tract birth umbilical arteries form internal iliac arteries
venous development
human venous system develops mainly vitelline veins umbilical veins cardinal veins empty sinus venosus
clinical significance
many diseases affect circulatory system includes cardiovascular disease affecting cardiovascular system lymphatic disease affecting lymphatic system cardiologists medical professionals specialise heart cardiothoracic surgeons specialise operating heart surrounding areas vascular surgeons focus parts circulatory system
cardiovascular disease
diseases affecting cardiovascular system called cardiovascular disease
many diseases called lifestyle diseases develop time related persons exercise habits diet whether smoke lifestyle choices person makes atherosclerosis precursor many diseases small atheromatous plaques build walls medium large arteries may eventually grow rupture occlude arteries also risk factor acute coronary syndromes diseases characterised sudden deficit oxygenated blood heart tissue atherosclerosis also associated problems aneurysm formation splitting dissection arteries
another major cardiovascular disease involves creation clot called thrombus originate veins arteries deep venous thrombosis mostly occurs legs one cause clots veins legs particularly person stationary long time clots may embolise meaning travel another location body results may include pulmonary embolus transient ischaemic attacks stroke
cardiovascular diseases may also congenital nature heart defects persistent fetal circulation circulatory changes supposed happen birth congenital changes circulatory system associated diseases large number anatomical variations
measurement techniques
function health circulatory system parts measured variety manual automated ways include simple methods part cardiovascular examination including taking persons pulse indicator persons heart rate taking blood pressure sphygmomanometer use stethoscope listen heart murmurs may indicate problems hearts valves electrocardiogram also used evaluate way electricity conducted heart
invasive means also used cannula catheter inserted artery may used measure pulse pressure pulmonary wedge pressures angiography involves injecting dye artery visualise arterial tree used heart coronary angiography brain time arteries visualised blockages narrowings may fixed insertion stents active bleeds may managed insertion coils mri may used image arteries called mri angiogram evaluation blood supply lungs ct pulmonary angiogram may used
ultrasound also used particularly identify health blood vessels doppler ultrasound carotid arteries doppler ultrasound lower limbs used evaluate narrowing carotid arteries thrombus formation legs respectively
surgery
number surgical procedures performed circulatory system
coronary artery bypass surgery
coronary stent used angioplasty
vascular surgery
vein stripping
cosmetic procedures
cardiovascular procedures likely performed inpatient setting ambulatory care setting united states cardiovascular surgeries performed ambulatory care setting
society culture
number alternative medical systems chinese medicine view circulatory system different ways
animals
vertebrates
circulatory systems vertebrates well annelids example earthworms cephalopods squids octopuses relatives closed humans still systems fish amphibians reptiles birds show various stages evolution circulatory system
fish system one circuit blood pumped capillaries gills capillaries body tissues known single cycle circulation heart fish therefore single pump consisting two chambers
amphibians reptiles double circulatory system used heart always completely separated two pumps amphibians threechambered heart
reptiles ventricular septum heart incomplete pulmonary artery equipped sphincter muscle allows second possible route blood flow instead blood flowing pulmonary artery lungs sphincter may contracted divert blood flow incomplete ventricular septum left ventricle aorta means blood flows capillaries heart back capillaries instead lungs process useful ectothermic coldblooded animals regulation body temperature
birds mammals crocodilians show complete separation heart two pumps total four heart chambers thought fourchambered heart birds crocodilians evolved independently mammals
open circulatory system
open circulatory system system fluid cavity called hemocoel bathes organs directly oxygen nutrients distinction blood interstitial fluid combined fluid called hemolymph haemolymph muscular movements animal locomotion facilitate hemolymph movement diverting flow one area another limited heart relaxes blood drawn back toward heart openended pores ostia
hemolymph fills interior hemocoel body surrounds cells hemolymph composed water inorganic salts mostly sodium chlorine potassium magnesium calcium organic compounds mostly carbohydrates proteins lipids primary oxygen transporter molecule hemocyanin
freefloating cells hemocytes within hemolymph play role arthropod immune system
absence circulatory system
circulatory systems absent animals including flatworms phylum platyhelminthes body cavity lining enclosed fluid instead muscular pharynx leads extensively branched digestive system facilitates direct diffusion nutrients cells flatworms dorsoventrally flattened body shape also restricts distance cell digestive system exterior organism oxygen diffuse surrounding water cells carbon dioxide diffuse consequently every cell able obtain nutrients water oxygen without need transport system
animals jellyfish extensive branching gastrovascular cavity functions place digestion form circulation branching allows bodily fluids reach outer layers since digestion begins inner layers
history
earliest known writings circulatory system found ebers papyrus th century bce ancient egyptian medical papyrus containing prescriptions remedies physical spiritual papyrus acknowledges connection heart arteries egyptians thought air came mouth lungs heart heart air travelled every member arteries although concept circulatory system partially correct represents one earliest accounts scientific thought
th century bce knowledge circulation vital fluids body known ayurvedic physician sushruta ancient india also seems possessed knowledge arteries described channels dwivedi dwivedi valves heart discovered physician hippocratean school around th century bce however function properly understood blood pools veins death arteries look empty ancient anatomists assumed filled air transport air
greek physician herophilus distinguished veins arteries thought pulse property arteries greek anatomist erasistratus observed arteries cut life bleed ascribed fact phenomenon air escaping artery replaced blood entered small vessels veins arteries thus apparently postulated capillaries reversed flow blood
nd century ad rome greek physician galen knew blood vessels carried blood identified venous dark red arterial brighter thinner blood distinct separate functions growth energy derived venous blood created liver chyle arterial blood gave vitality containing pneuma air originated heart blood flowed creating organs parts body consumed return blood heart liver heart pump blood around hearts motion sucked blood diastole blood moved pulsation arteries
galen believed arterial blood created venous blood passing left ventricle right passing pores interventricular septum air passed lungs via pulmonary artery left side heart arterial blood created sooty vapors created passed lungs also via pulmonary artery exhaled
canon medicine persian physician avicenna erroneously accepted greek notion regarding existence hole ventricular septum blood traveled ventricles despite avicenna correctly wrote cardiac cycles valvular function vision blood circulation treatise pulse also refining galens erroneous theory pulse avicenna provided first correct explanation pulsation every beat pulse comprises two movements two pauses thus expansion pause contraction pause pulse movement heart arteries takes form alternate expansion contraction
arabian physician ibn alnafis became first person accurately describe process pulmonary circulation sometimes considered father circulatory physiology ibn alnafis stated commentary anatomy avicennas canon
blood right chamber heart must arrive left chamber direct pathway thick septum heart perforated visible pores people thought invisible pores galen thought blood right chamber must flow vena arteriosa pulmonary artery lungs spread substances mingled air pass arteria venosa pulmonary vein reach left chamber heart form vital spirit
addition ibn alnafis insight would become larger theory capillary circulation stated must small communications pores manafidh arabic pulmonary artery vein prediction preceded discovery capillary system years ibn alnafis theory however confined blood transit lungs extend entire body
michael servetus first european describe function pulmonary circulation although achievement widely recognized time reasons firstly described manuscript paris near work never published later published description theological treatise christianismi restitutio book medicine three copies book survived rest burned shortly publication persecution servetus religious authorities better known discovery vesaliuss successor padua realdo colombo
finally william harvey pupil hieronymus fabricius earlier described valves veins without recognizing function performed sequence experiments published exercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis animalibus demonstrated direct connection venous arterial systems throughout body lungs importantly argued beat heart produced continuous circulation blood minute connections extremities body conceptual leap quite different ibn alnafis refinement anatomy bloodflow heart lungs work essentially correct exposition slowly convinced medical world however harvey able identify capillary system connecting arteries veins later discovered marcello malpighi
