eminent domain (united states the philippines) compulsory purchase (united kingdom new zealand ireland) resumption (hong kong) resumption/compulsory acquisition (australia) or expropriation (south africa canada) is the power of a state or a national government to take private property for public use however it can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities government subdivisions or even to private persons or corporations when they are authorized to exercise the functions of public character
the property may be taken either for government use or by delegation to third parties who will devote it to public or civic use or in some cases to economic development the most common uses of property taken by eminent domain are for government buildings and other facilities public utilities highways and railroads however it may also be taken for reasons of public safety as in the case of centralia pennsylvania some jurisdictions require that the condemnor make an offer to purchase the subject property before resorting to the use of eminent domain
== meaning ==
the term eminent domain was taken from the legal treatise de jure belli et pacis written by the dutch jurist hugo grotius in 1625 which used the term dominium eminens (latin for supreme lordship) and described the power as follows
 the property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state so that the state or he who acts for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property not only in the case of extreme necessity in which even private persons have a right over the property of others but for ends of public utility to which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed to have intended that private ends should give way but it is to be added that when this is done the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.
some u.s states use the term appropriation (new york) or expropriation (louisiana) as synonyms for the exercise of eminent domain powers
=== condemnation ===
the term condemnation is used to describe the formal act of the exercise of the power of eminent domain to transfer title to the property from its private owner to the government this use of the word should not be confused with its sense of a declaration that property is uninhabitable due to defects condemnation via eminent domain indicates the government is taking ownership of the property or some lesser interest in it such as an easement and must pay just compensation for it after the condemnation action is filed the amount of just compensation is determined in trial however in some cases the property owner challenges the right to take because the proposed taking is not for public use or the condemnor is not legislatively authorized to take the subject property or has not followed the proper substantive or procedural steps as required by law also in some cases the right to take may be denied by the courts for lack of public necessity for the taking (required by statute) but this is quite rare
=== other property ===
the exercise of eminent domain is not limited to real property governments may also condemn personal property governments can even condemn intangible property such as contract rights patents trade secrets and copyrights even the taking of professional sports team's franchise has been held by the california supreme court to be within the purview of the public use constitutional limitation although eventually that taking was not permitted because it was deemed to violate the interstate commerce clause of the u.s constitution

==== constitution ====
the practice of condemnation was transplanted into the american colonies with the common law in the early years unimproved land could be taken without compensation this practice was accepted because land was so abundant that it could be cheaply replaced when it came time to draft the united states constitution differing views on eminent domain were voiced thomas jefferson favored eliminating all remnants of feudalism and pushed for allodial ownership james madison who wrote the fifth amendment to the united states constitution had a more moderate view and struck a compromise that sought to at least protect property rights somewhat by explicitly mandating compensation and using the term public use rather than public purpose, public interest or public benefit
the fifth amendment imposes limitations on the exercise of eminent domain the taking must be for public use and just compensation must be paid some historians have suggested that these limitations on the taking power were inspired by the need to permit the army to secure mounts fodder and provisions from local ranchers and the perceived need to assure them compensation for such takings similarly soldiers forcibly sought housing in whatever homes were near their military assignments to address the latter problem the third amendment was enacted in 1791 as part of the us constitution's bill of rights it provided that the quartering of soldiers on private property could not take place in peacetime without the landowner's consent it also required that in wartime established law had to be followed in housing troops on private property presumably this would mandate just compensation, a requirement for the exercise of eminent domain in general per the fifth amendment all u.s states have legislation specifying eminent domain procedures within their respective territories
the power of governments to take private real or personal property has always existed in the united states as it was once claimed to be an inherent attribute of sovereignty this power reposes in the legislative branch of the government and may not be exercised unless the legislature has authorized its use by statutes that specify who may use it and for what purposes the legislature may take private property by passing an act transferring title to the government the property owner may then seek compensation by suing in the u.s court of federal claims the legislature may also delegate the power to private entities like public utilities or railroads and even to individuals for the purpose of acquiring access to their landlocked land its use was limited by the takings clause in the fifth amendment to the u.s constitution in 1791 which reads  nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. the fifth amendment did not create the national government's right to use the eminent domain power it simply limited it to public use
the u.s supreme court has consistently deferred to the right of states to make their own determinations of public use in 1832 the supreme court ruled that eminent domain could be used to allow a mill owner to expand his dam and operations by flooding an upstream neighbor the court opinion stated that a public use does not have to mean public occupation of the land it can mean a public benefit in clark vs nash (1905) the supreme court acknowledged that different parts of the country have unique circumstances and the definition of public use thus varied with the facts of the case it ruled a farmer could expand his irrigation ditch across another farmer's land (with compensation) because that farmer was entitled to the flow of the waters of the said fort canyon creek  and the uses of the said waters  [is] a public use. here in recognizing the arid climate and geography of utah the court indicated the farmer not adjacent to the river had as much right as the farmer who was to access the waters however until the 14th amendment was ratified in 1868 the limitations on eminent domain specified in the fifth amendment applied only to the federal government and not to the states that view ended in 1896 when in the chicago burlington & quincy railroad v chicago case the court held that the eminent domain provisions of the fifth amendment were incorporated in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and thus were now binding on the states or in other words when the states take private property they are required to devote it to a public use and compensate the property owner for his loss this was the beginning of what is now known as the selective incorporation doctrine
an expansive interpretation of eminent domain was reaffirmed in berman v parker (1954) in which the u.s supreme court reviewed an effort by the district of columbia to take and raze blighted structures in order to eliminate slums in the southwest washington area after the taking held the court the taken and razed land could be transferred to private redevelopers who would construct condominiums private office buildings and a shopping center the supreme court ruled against the owners of a non-blighted property within the area on the grounds that the project should be judged on its plans as a whole not on a parcel by parcel basis in hawaii housing authority v midkiff (1984) the supreme court approved the use of eminent domain to transfer a land lessor's title to its tenants who owned and occupied homes built on the leased land the court's justification was to break up a housing oligopoly and thereby lower or stabilize home prices although in reality following the midkiff decision home prices on oahu escalated dramatically more than doubling within a few years
the supreme court's decision in kelo v city of new london 545 u.s 469 (2005) affirmed the authority of new london connecticut to take non-blighted private property by eminent domain and then transfer it for a dollar a year to a private developer solely for the purpose of increasing municipal revenues this 5-4 decision received heavy press coverage and inspired a public outcry criticizing eminent domain powers as too broad in reaction to kelo several states enacted or are considering state legislation that would further define and restrict the power of eminent domain the supreme courts of illinois michigan (county of wayne v hathcock [2004]) ohio (norwood ohio v horney [2006]) oklahoma and south carolina have recently ruled to disallow such takings under their state constitutions
the redevelopment in new london the subject of the kelo decision proved to be a failure and as of 2012 (seven years after the court's decision) nothing has been built on the taken land in spite of the expenditure of over $100 million in public funds the pfizer corporation which owned a $300 million research facility in the area and would have been the primary beneficiary of the additional development announced in 2009 that it would close its facility and did so shortly before the expiration of its 10-year tax abatement agreement with the city the facility was subsequently purchased in 2010 for just $55 million by general dynamics electric boat
==== compensation ====
american courts have held that the preferred measure of just compensation is fair market value, i.e. the price that a willing but unpressured buyer would pay a willing but unpressured seller in a voluntary transaction with both parties fully informed of the property's good and bad features also this approach takes into account the property's highest and best use (i.e. its most profitable use) which is not necessarily its current use or the use mandated by current zoning if there is a reasonable probability of zone change
==== tax implications ====
when private property is destroyed condemned or disposed of the owner may receive a payment in property or money in the form of insurance or a condemnation award if property is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into money (as in eminent domain) the proceeds can be reinvested without payment of capital gains tax provided it is reinvested in property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted no capital gain shall be recognized
==== bush executive order ====
on june 23 2006 the first anniversary of the kelo decision (see above) president george w bush issued executive order 13406 which stated in section i that the federal government must limit its use of taking private property to public use with just compensation (both of which are phrases used in the u.s constitution) for the purpose of benefiting the general public. the order limits this use by stating that it may not be used for the purpose of advancing the economic interest of private parties to be given ownership or use of the property taken. however eminent domain is more often exercised by local and state governments albeit often with funds obtained from the federal government
=== canada ===
in canada expropriation is governed by federal or provincial statutes under these statutory regimes public authorities have the right to acquire private property for public purposes so long as the acquisition is approved by the appropriate government body once property is taken an owner is entitled to be made whole by compensation for the market value of the expropriated property injurious affection to the remainder of the property (if any) disturbance damages business loss and special difficulty relocating owners can advance claims for compensation above that initially provided by the expropriating authority by bringing a claim before the court or an administrative body appointed by the governing legislation
== europe ==
in many european nations the european convention on human rights provides protection from appropriation of private property by the state article 8 of the convention provides that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life his home and his correspondence and prohibits interference with this right by the state unless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the interests of national security public safety economic well-being of the country prevention of disorder or crime protection of health or morals or protection of the rights and freedoms of others this right is expanded by article 1 of the first protocol to the convention which states that every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. again this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or public interest is in accordance with law and in particular to secure payment of taxes settled case-law of echr provides that just compensation has to be paid in cases of expropriation
=== france ===
in france the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen similarly mandates just and preliminary compensation before expropriation and a dclaration d'utilit publique is commonly required to demonstrate a public benefit
notably in 1945 by decree of general charles de gaulle based on the untried accusations of collaboration the renault company was expropriated from louis renault posthumously and nationalised as rgie nationale des usines renault without compensation
=== england and wales ===
after his victory in 1066 william the conqueror seized virtually all land in england although he maintained absolute power over the land he granted fiefs to landholders who served as stewards paying fees and providing military services during the hundred years war in the 14th century edward iii used the crown's right of purveyance for massive expropriations chapter 28 of magna carta required that immediate cash payment be made for expropriations as the king's power was broken down in the ensuing centuries tenants were regarded as holding ownership rights rather than merely possessory rights over their land in 1427 a statute was passed granting commissioners of sewers in lincolnshire the power to take land without compensation after the early 16th century however parliamentary takings of land for roads bridges etc generally did require compensation the common practice was to pay 10% more than the assessed value however as the voting franchise was expanded to include more non-landowners the bonus was eliminated in spite of contrary statements found in some american law in the united kingdom compulsory purchase valuation cases were tried to juries well into the 20th century dekeyser's royal hotel v the king (1919)
in england and wales and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of english law the related term compulsory purchase is used the landowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate person where agreement on price cannot be achieved the value of the taken land is determined by the lands tribunal a court consisting of one barrister and two chartered surveyors the operative law is a patchwork of statutes and case law the principal acts are the lands clauses consolidation act 1845 the land compensation act 1961 the compulsory purchase act 1965 the land compensation act 1973 the acquisition of land act 1981 part ix of the town and country planning act 1990 the planning and compensation act 1991 and the planning and compulsory purchase act 2004
=== germany ===
the basic law for the federal republic of germany states in its article 14 (3) that an expropriation is only allowed for the public good and just compensation must be made it also provides for the right to have the amount of the compensation checked by a court
=== italy ===
esproprio or more formally espropriazione per pubblica utilit (literally expropriation for public utility") in italy takes place within the frame of civil law the law regulating expropriation is the d.p.r n.327 of 2001 amended by d.lgs n.302 of 2002 it supersedes the old expropriation law the royal decree n.2359 of 1865 also other national and regional laws may apply the general provisions for the expropriation stem from article 42 of the italian constitution and article 834 of the codice civile expropriation can be total (the whole property is expropriated) or partial permanent or temporary
nazionalizzazione ("nationalization") instead is provided for by article 43 of the constitution it transfers to governmental authority and property a whole industrial sector if it is deemed to be a natural or de facto monopoly and an essential service of public utility the most famous nationalization in italy was the 1962 nationalization of the electrical power sector
== australia ==
in australia section 51(xxxi) of the australian constitution permits the commonwealth parliament to make laws with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms from any state or person for any purpose in respect of which the parliament has power to make laws. this has been construed as meaning that just compensation may not always include monetary or proprietary recompense rather it is for the court to determine what is just it may be necessary to imply a need for compensation in the interests of justice lest the law be invalidated
property subject to resumption is not restricted to real estate as authority from the federal court has extended the states power to resume property to any form of physical property for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) money is not property which may be compulsorily acquired a statutory right to sue has been considered property under this section
the commonwealth must also derive some benefit from the property acquired that is the commonwealth can only legislate for the acquisition of property for particular purposes accordingly the power does not extend to allow legislation designed merely to seek to extinguish the previous owner's title the states and territories powers of resumption on the other hand are not so limited the section 43(1) of the lands acquisition act 1998 (nt) grants the minister the power to acquire land for any purpose whatever the high court of australia interpreted this provision literally relieving the territory government of any public purpose limitation on the power this finding permitted the territory government to acquire land subject to native title effectively extinguishing the native title interest in the land kirby j in dissent along with a number of commentators viewed this as a missed opportunity to comment on the exceptional nature of powers of resumption exercised in the absence of a public purpose limitation
the term resumption is a reflection of the fact that as a matter of australian law all land was originally owned by the crown before it was sold leased or granted and that through the act of compulsory acquisition the crown is resuming possession
== south america ==
=== chile ===
art 19 no 24 of the chilean constitution says in part anyone deprived of his property of the assets affected or any of the essential faculties or powers of ownership except by virtue of a general or a special law which authorizes expropriation for the public benefit or the national interest duly qualified by the legislator the expropriated party may protest the legality of the expropriation action before the ordinary courts of justice and shall at all times have the right to indemnification for patrimonial harm actually caused to be fixed by mutual agreement or by a sentence pronounced by said courts in accordance with the law.
the vast majority of expropriated owners accept the amount of the indemnification which usually is in line with real estate market values
== asia ==
=== india ===
the constitution originally provided for the right to property under articles 19 and 31 article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire hold and dispose of property article 31 provided that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. it also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property had been taken possession of or acquired for public purposes in addition both the state government as well as the union (federal) government were empowered to enact laws for the acquisition or requisition of property (schedule vii entry 42 list iii) it is this provision that has been interpreted as being the source of the state's eminent domain powers
the provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times the 44th amendment act of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights a new article article 300-a was added to the constitution which provided that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property it will not be unconstitutional the aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under article 32 thus the right to property is no longer a fundamental right though it is still a constitutional right if the government appears to have acted unfairly the action can be challenged in a court of law by citizens
land acquisition in india is currently governed by the right to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition rehabilitation and resettlement act 2013 which came into force from 1 january 2014 until 2013 land acquisition in india was governed by land acquisition act of 1894 however the new larr (amendment) ordinance 31 december 2014 diluted many clauses of the original act the liberalisation of the economy and the government's initiative to set up special economic zones have led to many protests by farmers and have opened up a debate on the reinstatement of the fundamental right to private property
=== pakistan ===
under the land acquisition act 1894 the government has the power to compulsorily acquire private land at the prevailing market rate for public purposes such as roads highways railways dams airports etc
== other countries ==
many countries recognize eminent domain to a much lesser extent than the english-speaking world or do not recognize it at all japan for instance has very weak eminent domain powers as evidenced by the high-profile opposition to the expansion of narita international airport and the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to residents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to leave one well-known recent case being that of roppongi hills
there are other countries such as the people's republic of china that practice eminent domain whenever it is convenient to make space for new communities and government structures singapore practices eminent domain under the land acquisitions act which allows it to carry out its selective en bloc redevelopment scheme for urban renewal the amendments to the land titles act allowed property to be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a collective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the minority did not thus eminent domain often invokes concerns of majoritarianism
since the 1990s the zimbabwean government under robert mugabe has seized a great deal of land and homes of mainly white farmers in the course of the land reform movement in zimbabwe the government argued that such land reform was necessary to redistribute the land to zimbabweans dispossessed of their lands during colonialism - these farmers were never compensated for this seizure
