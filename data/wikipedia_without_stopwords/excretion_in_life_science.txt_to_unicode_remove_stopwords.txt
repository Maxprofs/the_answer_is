excretion process waste products metabolism nonuseful materials eliminated organism vertebrates primarily carried lungs kidneys skin contrast secretion substance may specific tasks leaving cell excretion essential process forms life mammals urine carried urethra part excretory system
singlecelled organisms waste products discharged directly surface cell
green plants produce carbon dioxide water respiratory products green plants carbon dioxide released respiration gets utilized photosynthesis oxygen product generated photosynthesis exits stomata root cell walls routes plants get rid excess water transpiration guttation shown leaf acts excretophore addition green plants primary organ photosynthesis also used plants method excreting toxic wastes via diffusion waste materials exuded plants resin saps latex etc forced interior plant hydrostatic pressures inside plant absorptive forces plant cells latter processes need added energy act passively however preabscission phase metabolic levels leaf high plants also excrete waste substances soil around
animals main excretory products carbon dioxide ammonia ammoniotelics urea ureotelics uric acid uricotelics guanine arachnida creatine
aquatic animals usually excrete ammonia directly external environment compound high solubility ample water available dilution terrestrial animals ammonialike compounds converted nitrogenous materials less water environment ammonia toxic
birds excrete nitrogenous wastes uric acid form paste metabolically expensive allows efficient water retention stored easily egg many avian species especially seabirds also excrete salt via specialized nasal salt glands saline solution leaving nostrils beak
insects system involving malpighian tubules utilized excrete metabolic waste metabolic waste diffuses actively transported tubule transports wastes intestines metabolic waste released body along fecal matter
excreted material may called dejecta ejecta pathology word ejecta commonly used
