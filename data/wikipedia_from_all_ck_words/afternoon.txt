afternoon is the time of the day between noon and evening it is the time when the sun is descending from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction in human life it occupies roughly the latter half of the standard work and school day it is also associated with a number of concerns related to health safety and economic productivity generally the early afternoon after most people have eaten lunch corresponds to decreased work performance decreased alertness and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents
== terminology ==
afternoon is the time occurring between noon and evening the specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins for which there is no standard definition however before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries noon instead referred to 3 pmpossible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals along which one concept of noon was definedand so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe
the word afternoon which derives from after and noon has been attested from about the year 1300 middle english contained both afternoon and the synonym aftermete the standard locative marking for the word was at afternoon in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries but has shifted to in the afternoon since then in southern u.s and midland american english the word evening is sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and night the irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late afternoon to nightfall this period being considered mystical metaphorically the word afternoon refers to a relatively late period in the expanse of time or in one's life
the term should not be confused with after noon (two separate words) which is a translation of the latin post meridiem (p.m.) meaning a time between 12:00 midday and 12:00 midnight

afternoon is a time when the sun is descending from its daytime peak during the afternoon the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west in late afternoon sunlight is particularly bright and glaring because the sun is at a low angle in the sky the standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or eveningarchetypally 9 am to 5 pmso the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon schools usually let out during the afternoon as well
== effects on living organisms ==
=== hormones and body temperature ===
in diurnal animals it is typical for blood levels of the hormone cortisolwhich is used to increase blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stressto be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning however cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon as a result this time of day is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon owing to the sun's high angle in the sky the large proliferation of maize crops across earth has caused tiny harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening
in humans body temperature is typically highest during the mid to late afternoon however human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an eastwest (as opposed to northsouth) orientation to house their livestock because an eastwest orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon when these animals are too hot they are more likely to become belligerent and unproductive
=== alertness ===
the afternoon especially the early afternoon is associated with a dip in a variety of areas of human cognitive and productive functioning notably motor vehicle accidents are common in the early afternoon when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch a study of motor accidents in sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm this trend may have been influenced by the afternoon rush hour but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase in finland accidents in the agriculture industry are most common in the afternoon specifically monday afternoons in september
one psychology professor studying circadian rhythms found that his students performed somewhat worse on exams in the afternoon than in the morning but even worse in the evening neither of these differences however was statistically significant four studies carried out in 1997 found that subjects who were given tests on differentiating traffic signs had longer reaction times when tested at 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm than at 9:00 am and 12:00 pm these trends held across all four studies and for both complex and abstract questions
human productivity routinely decreases in the afternoon power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity in the afternoon compared to the morning the largest differences occurring on saturdays and the smallest on mondays one 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon the least productive time being their last hour at work it was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace another larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts
it is important to note however that not all humans share identical circadian rhythms one study across italy and spain had students fill out a questionnaire then ranked them on a morningnesseveningness scale the results were a fairly standard bell curve levels of alertness over the course of the day had a significant correlation with scores on the questionnaire all categories of participantsevening types morning types and intermediate typeshad high levels of alertness from roughly 2 pm to 8 pm but outside this window their alertness levels corresponded to their scores
