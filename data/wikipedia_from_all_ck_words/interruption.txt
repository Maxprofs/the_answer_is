a bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebral skeleton bones support and protect the various organs of the body produce red and white blood cells store minerals and also enable mobility bone tissue is a type of dense connective tissue bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure they are lightweight yet strong and hard and serve multiple functions mineralized osseous tissue or bone tissue is of two types cortical and cancellous and gives it rigidity and a coral-like three-dimensional internal structure other types of tissue found in bones include marrow endosteum periosteum nerves blood vessels and cartilage
bone is an active tissue composed of different cells osteoblasts are involved in the creation and mineralisation of bone osteocytes and osteoclasts are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue the mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component mainly of collagen and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts
in the human body at birth there are over 270 bones but many of these fuse together during development leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult not counting numerous small sesamoid bones the largest bone in the body is the thigh-bone (femur) and the smallest is the stapes in the middle ear
== structure ==
bone is not a uniformly solid material but is mostly a matrix the primary tissue of bone osseous tissue is relatively hard and lightweight its matrix is mostly made up of a composite material incorporating the inorganic mineral calcium phosphate in the chemical arrangement termed calcium hydroxylapatite (this is the osseous tissue that gives bones their rigidity) and organic collagen an elastic protein which improves fracture resistance bone is formed by the hardening of this matrix around entrapped cells when these cells become entrapped from osteoblasts they become osteocytes
=== layered structure ===
==== cortical bone ====
the hard outer layer of bones is composed of cortical bone also called compact bone cortical referring to the outer (cortex) layer the hard outer layer gives bone its smooth white and solid appearance and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human skeleton however that proportion may be much lower especially in marine mammals and marine turtles or in various mesozoic marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs among others
cortical bone consists of multiple microscopic columns each called an osteon each column is multiple layers of osteoblasts and osteocytes around a central canal called the haversian canal volkmann's canals at right angles connect the osteons together the columns are metabolically active and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change cortical bone is covered by a periosteum on its outer surface and an endosteum on its inner surface the endosteum is the boundary between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone
==== cancellous bone ====
filling the interior of the bone is the cancellous bone also known as trabecular or spongy bone tissue it is an open cell porous network thin formations of osteoblasts covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces within these spaces are bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cells that give rise to platelets red blood cells and white blood cells trabecular marrow is composed of a network of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ lighter and allow room for blood vessels and marrow trabecular bone accounts for the remaining 20% of total bone mass but has nearly ten times the surface area of compact bone
==== bone marrow ====
bone marrow also known as myeloid tissue can be found in almost any bone that holds cancellous tissue in newborns all such bones are filled exclusively with red marrow but as the child ages it is mostly replaced by yellow or fatty marrow in adults red marrow is mostly found in the bone marrow of the femur the ribs the vertebrae and pelvic bones
=== composition ===
==== cells ====
bone is a metabolically active tissue composed of several types of cells these cells include osteoblasts which are involved in the creation and mineralization of bone tissue osteocytes and osteoclasts which are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue osteoblasts and osteocytes are derived from osteoprogenitor cells but osteoclasts are derived from the same cells that differentiate to form macrophages and monocytes within the marrow of the bone there are also hematopoietic stem cells these cells give rise to other cells including white blood cells red blood cells and platelets
osteoblasts are mononucleate bone-forming cells they are located on the surface of osteoid seams and make a protein mixture known as osteoid which mineralizes to become bone the osteoid seam is a narrow region of newly formed organic matrix not yet mineralized located on the surface of a bone osteoid is primarily composed of type i collagen osteoblasts also manufacture hormones such as prostaglandins to act on the bone itself they robustly produce alkaline phosphatase an enzyme that has a role in the mineralisation of bone as well as many matrix proteins
osteocytes are mostly inactive osteoblasts osteocytes originate from osteoblasts that have migrated into and become trapped and surrounded by bone matrix that they themselves produced the spaces they occupy are known as lacunae osteocytes have many processes that reach out to meet osteoblasts and other osteocytes probably for the purposes of communication
osteoclasts are the cells responsible for bone resorption thus they break down bone new bone is then formed by the osteoblasts bone is constantly remodelled by the resorption of osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts osteoclasts are large cells with multiple nuclei located on bone surfaces in what are called howship's lacunae (or resorption pits) these lacunae are the result of surrounding bone tissue that has been reabsorbed because the osteoclasts are derived from a monocyte stem-cell lineage they are equipped with phagocytic-like mechanisms similar to circulating macrophages osteoclasts mature and/or migrate to discrete bone surfaces upon arrival active enzymes such as tartrate resistant acid phosphatase are secreted against the mineral substrate the reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts also plays a role in calcium homeostasis
==== extracellular ====
bones consist of living cells embedded in a mineralized organic matrix this matrix consists of organic components mainly collagen organic referring to materials produced as a result of the human body and inorganic components primarily hydroxyapatite and other salts of calcium and phosphate above 30% of the acellular part of bone consists of the organic components and 70% of salts the strands of collagen give bone its tensile strength and the interspersed crystals of hydroxyapatite give bone its compressional strength these effects are synergistic
the inorganic composition of bone (bone mineral) is primarily formed from salts of calcium and phosphate the major salt being hydroxyapatite (ca10(po4)6(oh)2) the exact composition of the matrix may change over time and with nutrition with the ratio of calcium to phosphate varying between 1.3 and 2.0 (per weight) and trace minerals such as magnesium sodium potassium and carbonate also being found
the organic part of matrix is mainly composed of type i collagen collagen composes 9095% of the organic matrix with remainder of the matrix being a homogenous liquid called ground substance consisting of proteoglycans such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate collagen consists of strands of repeating units which give bone tensile strength and are arranged in an overlapping fashion that prevents sheer stress the function of ground substance is not fully known two types of bone can be identified microscopically according to the arrangement of collagen
woven bone which is characterized by haphazard organization of collagen fibers and is mechanically weak
lamellar bone which has a regular parallel alignment of collagen into sheets ("lamellae") and is mechanically strong
woven bone is produced when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly which occurs initially in all fetal bones but is later replaced by more resilient lamellar bone in adults woven bone is created after fractures or in paget's disease woven bone is weaker with a smaller number of randomly oriented collagen fibers but forms quickly it is for this appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed woven it is soon replaced by lamellar bone which is highly organized in concentric sheets with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue lamellar bone which makes its first appearance in the fetus during the third trimester is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are called osteons) in cross-section the fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers much like in plywood assisting in the bone's ability to resist torsion forces after a fracture woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as bony substitution. compared to woven bone lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly the orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2 m per day lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen fibers in parallel or concentric layers
deposition
the extracellular matrix of bone is laid down by osteoblasts which secrete both collagen and ground substance these synthesise collagen within the cell and then secrete collagen fibrils the collagen fibres rapidly polymerise to form collagen strands at this stage they are not yet mineralised and are called osteoid around the strands calcium and phosphate precipitate on the surface of these strands within a days to weeks becoming crystals of hydroxyapatite
in order to mineralise the bone the osteoblasts secrete vesicles containing alkaline phosphatase this cleaves the phosphate groups and acts as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition the vesicles then rupture and act as a centre for crystals to grow on more particularly bone mineral is formed from globular and plate structures distributed among the collagen fibrils of bone and forming yet larger structure
=== types ===
there are five types of bones in the human body long short flat irregular and sesamoid
long bones are characterized by a shaft the diaphysis that is much longer than its width and by an epiphysis a rounded head at each end of the shaft they are made up mostly of compact bone with lesser amounts of marrow located within the medullary cavity and spongy cancellous bone most bones of the limbs including those of the fingers and toes are long bones the exceptions are those of the wrist ankle and kneecap
short bones are roughly cube-shaped and have only a thin layer of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior the bones of the wrist and ankle are short bones as are the sesamoid bones
flat bones are thin and generally curved with two parallel layers of compact bones sandwiching a layer of spongy bone most of the bones of the skull are flat bones as is the sternum
sesamoid bones are bones embedded in tendons since they act to hold the tendon further away from the joint the angle of the tendon is increased and thus the leverage of the muscle is increased examples of sesamoid bones are the patella and the pisiform
irregular bones do not fit into the above categories they consist of thin layers of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior as implied by the name their shapes are irregular and complicated often this irregular shape is due to their many centers of ossification or because they contain bony sinuses the bones of the spine pelvis and some bones of the skull are irregular bones examples include the ethmoid and sphenoid bones
=== terminology ===
in the study of anatomy anatomists use a number of anatomical terms to describe the appearance shape and function of bones other anatomical terms are also used to describe the location of bones like other anatomical terms many of these derive from latin and greek some anatomists still use latin to refer to bones the term osseous and the prefix osteo- referring to things related to bone are still used commonly today
some examples of terms used to describe bones include the term foramen to describe a hole through which something passes and a canal or meatus to describe a tunnel-like structure a protrusion from a bone can be called a number of terms including a condyle crest spine eminence tubercle or tuberosity depending on the protrusion's shape and location in general long bones are said to have a head neck and body
when two bones join together they are said to articulate if the two bones have a fibrous connection and are relatively immobile then the joint is called a suture
== development ==
the formation of bone is called ossification during the fetal stage of development this occurs by two processes intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification intramembranous ossification involves the creation of bone from connective tissue whereas in the process of endochondral ossification bone is created from cartilage
=== intramembranous ossification ===
intramembranous ossification mainly occurs during formation of the flat bones of the skull but also the mandible maxilla and clavicles the bone is formed from connective tissue such as mesenchyme tissue rather than from cartilage the steps in intramembranous ossification are
development of ossification center
calcification
formation of trabeculae
development of periosteum
=== endochondral ossification ===
endochondral ossification on the other hand occurs in long bones and most of the rest of the bones in the body it involves an initial hyaline cartilage that continues to grow the steps in endochondral ossification are
development of cartilage model
growth of cartilage model
development of the primary ossification center
development of the secondary ossification center
formation of articular cartilage and epiphyseal plate
endochondral ossification begins with points in the cartilage called primary ossification centers. they mostly appear during fetal development though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after birth they are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones short bones and certain parts of irregular bones secondary ossification occurs after birth and forms the epiphyses of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones the diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the epiphyseal plate) when the child reaches skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age) all of the cartilage is replaced by bone fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure) in the upper limbs only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified the epiphyses carpal bones coracoid process medial border of the scapula and acromion are still cartilaginous
the following steps are followed in the conversion of cartilage to bone
zone of reserve cartilage this region farthest from the marrow cavity consists of typical hyaline cartilage that as yet shows no sign of transforming into bone
zone of cell proliferation a little closer to the marrow cavity chondrocytes multiply and arrange themselves into longitudinal columns of flattened lacunae
zone of cell hypertrophy next the chondrocytes cease to divide and begin to hypertrophy (enlarge) much like they do in the primary ossification center of the fetus the walls of the matrix between lacunae become very thin
zone of calcification minerals are deposited in the matrix between the columns of lacunae and calcify the cartilage these are not the permanent mineral deposits of bone but only a temporary support for the cartilage that would otherwise soon be weakened by the breakdown of the enlarged lacunae
zone of bone deposition within each column the walls between the lacunae break down and the chondrocytes die this converts each column into a longitudinal channel which is immediately invaded by blood vessels and marrow from the marrow cavity osteoblasts line up along the walls of these channels and begin depositing concentric lamellae of matrix while osteoclasts dissolve the temporarily calcified cartilage
== function ==
bones have a variety of functions
=== mechanical ===
bones serve a variety of mechanical functions together the bones in the body form the skeleton they provide a frame to keep the body supported and an attachment point for skeletal muscles tendons ligaments and joints which function together to generate and transfer forces so that individual body parts or the whole body can be manipulated in three-dimensional space (the interaction between bone and muscle is studied in biomechanics)
bones protect internal organs such as the skull protecting the brain or the ribs protecting the heart and lungs because of the way that bone is formed bone has a high compressive strength of about 170 mpa (1800 kgf/cm) poor tensile strength of 104121 mpa and a very low shear stress strength (51.6 mpa) this means that bone resists pushing(compressional) stress well resist pulling(tensional) stress less well but only poorly resists shear stress (such as due to torsional loads) while bone is essentially brittle bone does have a significant degree of elasticity contributed chiefly by collagen
mechanically bones also have a special role in hearing the ossicles are three small bones in the middle ear which are involved in sound transduction
=== synthetic ===
cancellous bones contain bone marrow bone marrow produces blood cells in a process called hematopoiesis blood cells that are created in bone marrow include red blood cells platelets and white blood cells progenitor cells such as the hematopoietic stem cell divide in a process called mitosis to produce precursor cells these include precursors which eventually give rise to white blood cells and erythroblasts which give rise to red blood cells unlike red and white blood cells created by mitosis platelets are shed from very large cells called megakaryocytes this process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow after the cells are matured they enter the circulation every day over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets and 50100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way
as well as creating cells bone marrow is also one of the major sites where defective or aged red blood cells are destroyed
=== metabolic ===
mineral storage bones act as reserves of minerals important for the body most notably calcium and phosphorus
growth factor storage mineralized bone matrix stores important growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors transforming growth factor bone morphogenetic proteins and others
fat storage the yellow bone marrow acts as a storage reserve of fatty acids
acid-base balance bone buffers the blood against excessive ph changes by absorbing or releasing alkaline salts
detoxification bone tissues can also store heavy metals and other foreign elements removing them from the blood and reducing their effects on other tissues these can later be gradually released for excretion
endocrine organ bone controls phosphate metabolism by releasing fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23) which acts on kidneys to reduce phosphate reabsorption bone cells also release a hormone called osteocalcin which contributes to the regulation of blood sugar (glucose) and fat deposition osteocalcin increases both the insulin secretion and sensitivity in addition to boosting the number of insulin-producing cells and reducing stores of fat
calcium balancethe process of bone resorption by the osteoclasts releases stored calcium into the systemic circulation and is an important process in regulating calcium balance as bone formation actively fixes circulating calcium in its mineral form removing it from the bloodstream resorption actively unfixes it thereby increasing circulating calcium levels these processes occur in tandem at site-specific locations
=== remodeling ===
bone is constantly being created and replaced in a process known as remodeling this ongoing turnover of bone is a process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape this is accomplished through osteoblasts and osteoclasts cells are stimulated by a variety of signals and together referred to as a remodeling unit approximately 10% of the skeletal mass of an adult is remodelled each year the purpose of remodeling is to regulate calcium homeostasis repair microdamaged bones from everyday stress and also to shape and sculpt the skeleton during growth repeated stress such as weight-bearing exercise or bone healing results in the bone thickening at the points of maximum stress (wolff's law) it has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone's piezoelectric properties which cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress
the action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are controlled by a number of chemical enzymes that either promote or inhibit the activity of the bone remodeling cells controlling the rate at which bone is made destroyed or changed in shape the cells also use paracrine signalling to control the activity of each other for example the rate at which osteoclasts resorb bone is inhibited by calcitonin and osteoprotegerin calcitonin is produced by parafollicular cells in the thyroid gland and can bind to receptors on osteoclasts to directly inhibit osteoclast activity osteoprotegerin is secreted by osteoblasts and is able to bind rank-l inhibiting osteoclast stimulation
osteoblasts can also be stimulated to increase bone mass through increased secretion of osteoid and by inhibiting the ability of osteoclasts to break down osseous tissue increased secretion of osteoid is stimulated by the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary thyroid hormone and the sex hormones (estrogens and androgens) these hormones also promote increased secretion of osteoprotegerin osteoblasts can also be induced to secrete a number of cytokines that promote reabsorbtion of bone by stimulating osteoclast activity and differentiation from progenitor cells vitamin d parathyroid hormone and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase secretion of rank-ligand and interleukin 6 which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts these same compounds also increase secretion of macrophage colony-stimulating factor by osteoblasts which promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts and decrease secretion of osteoprotegerin
=== bone volume ===
bone volume is determined by the rates of bone formation and bone resorption recent research has suggested that certain growth factors may work to locally alter bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity numerous bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and classified via bone cultures these factors include insulin-like growth factors i and ii transforming growth factor-beta fibroblast growth factor platelet-derived growth factor and bone morphogenetic proteins evidence suggests that bone cells produce growth factors for extracellular storage in the bone matrix the release of these growth factors from the bone matrix could cause the proliferation of osteoblast precursors essentially bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local bone formation research has suggested that trabecular bone volume in postemenopausal osteoporosis may be determined by the relationship between the total bone forming surface and the percent of surface resorption
== clinical significance ==
a number of diseases can affect bone including arthritis fractures infections osteoporosis and tumours conditions relating to bone can be managed by a variety of doctors including rheumatologists for joints and orthopedic surgeons who may conduct surgery to fix broken bones other doctors such as rehabilitation specialists may be involved in recovery radiologists in interpreting the findings on imaging and pathologists in investigating the cause of the disease and family doctors may play a role in preventing complications of bone disease such as osteoporosis
when a doctor sees a patient a history and exam will be taken bones are then often imaged called radiography this might include ultrasound x-ray ct scan mri scan and other imaging such as a bone scan which may be used to investigate cancer other tests such as a blood test for autoimmune markers may be taken or a synovial fluid aspirate may be taken
=== fractures ===
in normal bone fractures occur when there is significant force applied or repetitive trauma over a long time fractures can also occur when a bone is weakened such as with osteoporosis or when there is a structural problem such as when the bone remodels excessively (such as paget's disease) or is the site of the growth of cancer common fractures include wrist fractures and hip fractures associated with osteoporosis vertebral fractures associated with high-energy trauma and cancer and fractures of long-bones not all fractures are painful when serious depending on the fractures type and location complications may include flail chest compartment syndromes or fat embolism compound fractures involve the bone's penetration through the skin
fractures and their underlying causes can be investigated by x-rays ct scans and mris fractures are described by their location and shape and several classification systems exist depending on the location of the fracture fractures in children are described with the salterharris fracture when fractures are managed pain relief is often given and the fractured area is often immobilised this is to promote bone healing in addition surgical measures such as internal fixation may be used because of the immobilisation people with fractures are often advised to undergo rehabilitation
=== tumours ===
there are several types of tumour that can affect bone examples of benign bone tumours include osteoma osteoid osteoma osteochondroma osteoblastoma enchondroma giant cell tumor of bone aneurysmal bone cyst and fibrous dysplasia of bone
=== cancer ===
cancer can arise in bone tissue and bones are also a common site for other cancers to spread (metastasise) to cancers that arise in bone are called primary cancers although such cancers are rare metastases within bone are secondary cancers with the most common being breast cancer lung cancer prostate cancer thyroid cancer and kidney cancer secondary cancers that affect bone can either destroy bone (called a lytic cancer) or create bone (a sclerotic cancer) cancers of the bone marrow inside the bone can also affect bone tissue examples including leukemia and multiple myeloma bone may also be affected by cancers in other parts of the body cancers in other parts of the body may release parathyroid hormone or parathyroid hormone-related peptide this increases bone reabsorption and can lead to bone fractures
bone tissue that is destroyed or altered as a result of cancers is distorted weakened and more prone to fracture this may lead to compression of the spinal cord destruction of the marrow resulting in bruising bleeding and immunosuppression and is one cause of bone pain if the cancer is metastatic then there might be other symptoms depending on the site of the original cancer some bone cancers can also be felt
cancers of the bone are managed according to their type their stage prognosis and what symptoms they cause many primary cancers of bone are treated with radiotherapy cancers of bone marrow may be treated with chemotherapy and other forms of targeted therapy such as immunotherapy may be used palliative care which focuses on maximising a person's quality of life may play a role in management particularly if the likelihood of survival within five years is poor
=== painful conditions ===
osteomyelitis is inflammation of the bone or bone marrow due to bacterial infection
osteogenesis imperfecta
osteochondritis dissecans
arthritis
ankylosing spondylitis
skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by an excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones in advanced cases skeletal fluorosis damages bones and joints and is painful
=== osteoporosis ===
osteoporosis is a disease of bone where there is reduced bone mineral density increasing the likelihood of fractures osteoporosis is defined by the world health organization in women as a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass relative to the age and sex-matched average as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry with the term established osteoporosis including the presence of a fragility fracture osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause when it is called postmenopausal osteoporosis but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications specifically glucocorticoids osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs for this reason dexa scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture
osteoporosis treatment includes advice to stop smoking decrease alcohol consumption exercise regularly and have a healthy diet calcium supplements may also be advised as may vitamin d when medication is used it may include bisphosphonates strontium ranelate and osteoporosis may be one factor considered when commencing hormone replacement therapy
== osteology ==
the study of bones and teeth is referred to as osteology it is frequently used in anthropology archeology and forensic science for a variety of tasks this can include determining the nutritional health age or injury status of the individual the bones were taken from preparing fleshed bones for these types of studies can involve the process of maceration
typically anthropologists and archeologists study bone tools made by homo sapiens and homo neanderthalensis bones can serve a number of uses such as projectile points or artistic pigments and can also be made from external bones such as antlers
== other animals ==
bird skeletons are very lightweight their bones are smaller and thinner to aid flight among mammals bats come closest to birds in terms of bone density suggesting that small dense bones are a flight adaptation many bird bones have little marrow due to their being hollow
a bird's beak is primarily made of bone as projections of the mandibles which are covered in keratin
a deer's antlers are composed of bone which is an unusual example of bone being outside the body
the extinct predatory fish dunkleosteus had sharp edges of hard exposed bone along its jaws
many animals possess an exoskeleton that is not made of bone these include insects and crustaceans
== society and culture ==
bones from slaughtered animals have a number of uses in prehistoric times they have been used for making bone tools they have further been used in bone carving already important in prehistoric art and also in modern time as crafting materials for buttons beads handles bobbins calculation aids head nuts dice poker chips pick-up sticks ornaments etc a special genre is scrimshaw
bone glue can be made by prolonged boiling of ground or cracked bones followed by filtering and evaporation to thicken the resulting fluid historically once important bone glue and other animal glues today have only a few specialized uses such as in antiques restoration essentially the same process with further refinement thickening and drying is used to make gelatin
broth is made by simmering several ingredients for a long time traditionally including bones
ground bones are used as an organic phosphorus-nitrogen fertilizer and as additive in animal feed bones in particular after calcination to bone ash are used as source of calcium phosphate for the production of bone china and previously also phosphorus chemicals
bone char a porous black granular material primarily used for filtration and also as a black pigment is produced by charring mammal bones
oracle bone script was a writing system used in ancient china based on inscriptions in bones
to point the bone at someone is considered bad luck in some cultures such as australian aborigines such as by the kurdaitcha
osteopathic medicine is a school of medical thought originally developed based on the idea of the link between the musculoskeletal system and overall health but now very similar to mainstream medicine as of 2012 over 77,000 physicians in the united states are trained in osteopathic medicine colleges
the wishbones of fowl have been used for divination and are still customarily used in a tradition to determine which one of two people pulling on either prong of the bone may make a wish
various cultures throughout history have adopted the custom of shaping an infant's head by the practice of artificial cranial deformation a widely practised custom in china was that of foot binding to limit the normal growth of the foot
