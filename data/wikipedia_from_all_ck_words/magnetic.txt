magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field which acts on other currents and magnetic moments every material is influenced to some extent by a magnetic field the most familiar effect is on permanent magnets which have persistent magnetic moments caused by ferromagnetism most materials do not have permanent moments some are attracted to a magnetic field (paramagnetism) others are repulsed by a magnetic field (diamagnetism) others have a more complex relationship with an applied magnetic field (spin glass behavior and antiferromagnetism) substances that are negligibly affected by magnetic fields are known as non-magnetic substances these include copper aluminium gases and plastic pure oxygen exhibits magnetic properties when cooled to a liquid state
the magnetic state (or magnetic phase) of a material depends on temperature and other variables such as pressure and the applied magnetic field a material may exhibit more than one form of magnetism as these variables change
== historyedit ==
aristotle attributed the first of what could be called a scientific discussion on magnetism to thales of miletus who lived from about 625 bc to about 545 bc around the same time in ancient india the indian surgeon sushruta was the first to make use of the magnet for surgical purposes
in ancient china the earliest literary reference to magnetism lies in a 4th-century bc book named after its author the master of demon valley () the lodestone makes iron come or it attracts it. the earliest mention of the attraction of a needle appears in a work composed between ad 20 and 100 (louen-heng) a lodestone attracts a needle. the chinese scientist shen kuo (10311095) was the first person to write of the magnetic needle compass and that it improved the accuracy of navigation by employing the astronomical concept of true north (dream pool essays ad 1088) and by the 12th century the chinese were known to use the lodestone compass for navigation they sculpted a directional spoon from lodestone in such a way that the handle of the spoon always pointed south
alexander neckam by 1187 was the first in europe to describe the compass and its use for navigation in 1269 peter peregrinus de maricourt wrote the epistola de magnete the first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets in 1282 the properties of magnets and the dry compass were discussed by al-ashraf a yemeni physicist astronomer and geographer
in 1600 william gilbert published his de magnete magneticisque corporibus et de magno magnete tellure (on the magnet and magnetic bodies and on the great magnet the earth) in this work he describes many of his experiments with his model earth called the terrella from his experiments he concluded that the earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses pointed north (previously some believed that it was the pole star (polaris) or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass)
an understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism began in 1819 with work by hans christian rsted a professor at the university of copenhagen who discovered more or less by accident that an electric current could influence a compass needle this landmark experiment is known as rsted's experiment several other experiments followed with andr-marie ampre who in 1820 discovered that the magnetic field circulating in a closed-path was related to the current flowing through the perimeter of the path carl friedrich gauss jean-baptiste biot and flix savart both of whom in 1820 came up with the biotsavart law giving an equation for the magnetic field from a current-carrying wire michael faraday who in 1831 found that a time-varying magnetic flux through a loop of wire induced a voltage and others finding further links between magnetism and electricity james clerk maxwell synthesized and expanded these insights into maxwell's equations unifying electricity magnetism and optics into the field of electromagnetism in 1905 einstein used these laws in motivating his theory of special relativity requiring that the laws held true in all inertial reference frames
electromagnetism has continued to develop into the 21st century being incorporated into the more fundamental theories of gauge theory quantum electrodynamics electroweak theory and finally the standard model
== sources of magnetismedit ==
magnetism at its root arises from two sources
electric current (see electron magnetic moment)
spin magnetic moments of elementary particles the magnetic moments of the nuclei of atoms are typically thousands of times smaller than the electrons magnetic moments so they are negligible in the context of the magnetization of materials nuclear magnetic moments are very important in other contexts particularly in nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and magnetic resonance imaging (mri)
ordinarily the enormous number of electrons in a material are arranged such that their magnetic moments (both orbital and intrinsic) cancel out this is due to some extent to electrons combining into pairs with opposite intrinsic magnetic moments as a result of the pauli exclusion principle (see electron configuration) or combining into filled subshells with zero net orbital motion in both cases the electron arrangement is so as to exactly cancel the magnetic moments from each electron moreover even when the electron configuration is such that there are unpaired electrons and/or non-filled subshells it is often the case that the various electrons in the solid will contribute magnetic moments that point in different random directions so that the material will not be magnetic
however sometimeseither spontaneously or owing to an applied external magnetic fieldeach of the electron magnetic moments will be on average lined up then the material can produce a net total magnetic field which can potentially be quite strong
the magnetic behavior of a material depends on its structure particularly its electron configuration for the reasons mentioned above and also on the temperature at high temperatures random thermal motion makes it more difficult for the electrons to maintain alignment
== materialsedit ==
=== diamagnetismedit ===
diamagnetism appears in all materials and is the tendency of a material to oppose an applied magnetic field and therefore to be repelled by a magnetic field however in a material with paramagnetic properties (that is with a tendency to enhance an external magnetic field) the paramagnetic behavior dominates thus despite its universal occurrence diamagnetic behavior is observed only in a purely diamagnetic material in a diamagnetic material there are no unpaired electrons so the intrinsic electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk effect in these cases the magnetization arises from the electrons orbital motions which can be understood classically as follows
when a material is put in a magnetic field the electrons circling the nucleus will experience in addition to their coulomb attraction to the nucleus a lorentz force from the magnetic field depending on which direction the electron is orbiting this force may increase the centripetal force on the electrons pulling them in towards the nucleus or it may decrease the force pulling them away from the nucleus this effect systematically increases the orbital magnetic moments that were aligned opposite the field and decreases the ones aligned parallel to the field (in accordance with lenz's law) this results in a small bulk magnetic moment with an opposite direction to the applied field
note that this description is meant only as an heuristic a proper understanding requires a quantum-mechanical description
note that all materials undergo this orbital response however in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the diamagnetic effect is overwhelmed by the much stronger effects caused by the unpaired electrons
=== paramagnetismedit ===
in a paramagnetic material there are unpaired electrons i.e atomic or molecular orbitals with exactly one electron in them while paired electrons are required by the pauli exclusion principle to have their intrinsic ('spin') magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions causing their magnetic fields to cancel out an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction when an external magnetic field is applied these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves in the same direction as the applied field thus reinforcing it
=== ferromagnetismedit ===
a ferromagnet like a paramagnetic substance has unpaired electrons however in addition to the electrons intrinsic magnetic moment's tendency to be parallel to an applied field there is also in these materials a tendency for these magnetic moments to orient parallel to each other to maintain a lowered-energy state thus even in the absence of an applied field the magnetic moments of the electrons in the material spontaneously line up parallel to one another
every ferromagnetic substance has its own individual temperature called the curie temperature or curie point above which it loses its ferromagnetic properties this is because the thermal tendency to disorder overwhelms the energy-lowering due to ferromagnetic order
ferromagnetism only occurs in a few substances the common ones are iron nickel cobalt their alloys and some alloys of rare earth metals
==== magnetic domainsedit ====
the magnetic moments of atoms in a ferromagnetic material cause them to behave something like tiny permanent magnets they stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or weiss domains magnetic domains can be observed with a magnetic force microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch there are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields
when a domain contains too many molecules it becomes unstable and divides into two domains aligned in opposite directions so that they stick together more stably as shown at the right
when exposed to a magnetic field the domain boundaries move so that the domains aligned with the magnetic field grow and dominate the structure (dotted yellow area) as shown at the left when the magnetizing field is removed the domains may not return to an unmagnetized state this results in the ferromagnetic material's being magnetized forming a permanent magnet
when magnetized strongly enough that the prevailing domain overruns all others to result in only one single domain the material is magnetically saturated when a magnetized ferromagnetic material is heated to the curie point temperature the molecules are agitated to the point that the magnetic domains lose the organization and the magnetic properties they cause cease when the material is cooled this domain alignment structure spontaneously returns in a manner roughly analogous to how a liquid can freeze into a crystalline solid
=== antiferromagnetismedit ===
in an antiferromagnet unlike a ferromagnet there is a tendency for the intrinsic magnetic moments of neighboring valence electrons to point in opposite directions when all atoms are arranged in a substance so that each neighbor is anti-aligned the substance is antiferromagnetic antiferromagnets have a zero net magnetic moment meaning no field is produced by them antiferromagnets are less common compared to the other types of behaviors and are mostly observed at low temperatures in varying temperatures antiferromagnets can be seen to exhibit diamagnetic and ferrimagnetic properties
in some materials neighboring electrons want to point in opposite directions but there is no geometrical arrangement in which each pair of neighbors is anti-aligned this is called a spin glass and is an example of geometrical frustration
=== ferrimagnetismedit ===
like ferromagnetism ferrimagnets retain their magnetization in the absence of a field however like antiferromagnets neighboring pairs of electron spins like to point in opposite directions these two properties are not contradictory because in the optimal geometrical arrangement there is more magnetic moment from the sublattice of electrons that point in one direction than from the sublattice that points in the opposite direction
most ferrites are ferrimagnetic the first discovered magnetic substance magnetite is a ferrite and was originally believed to be a ferromagnet louis nel disproved this however after discovering ferrimagnetism
=== superparamagnetismedit ===
when a ferromagnet or ferrimagnet is sufficiently small it acts like a single magnetic spin that is subject to brownian motion its response to a magnetic field is qualitatively similar to the response of a paramagnet but much larger
=== other types of magnetismedit ===
metamagnetism
molecule-based magnet
spin glass
== electromagnetedit ==
an electromagnet is a type of magnet whose magnetism is produced by the flow of electric current the magnetic field disappears when the current ceases
== magnetism electricity and special relativityedit ==
as a consequence of einstein's theory of special relativity electricity and magnetism are fundamentally interlinked both magnetism lacking electricity and electricity without magnetism are inconsistent with special relativity due to such effects as length contraction time dilation and the fact that the magnetic force is velocity-dependent however when both electricity and magnetism are taken into account the resulting theory (electromagnetism) is fully consistent with special relativity in particular a phenomenon that appears purely electric or purely magnetic to one observer may be a mix of both to another or more generally the relative contributions of electricity and magnetism are dependent on the frame of reference thus special relativity mixes electricity and magnetism into a single inseparable phenomenon called electromagnetism analogous to how relativity mixes space and time into spacetime
all observations on electromagnetism apply to what might be considered to be primarily magnetism e.g perturbations in the magnetic field are necessarily accompanied by a nonzero electric field and propagate at the speed of light
== magnetic fields in a materialedit ==
in a vacuum
where 0 is the vacuum permeability
in a material
the quantity 0m is called magnetic polarization
if the field h is small the response of the magnetization m in a diamagnet or paramagnet is approximately linear
the constant of proportionality being called the magnetic susceptibility if so
in a hard magnet such as a ferromagnet m is not proportional to the field and is generally nonzero even when h is zero (see remanence)
== magnetic forceedit ==
the phenomenon of magnetism is mediated by the magnetic field an electric current or magnetic dipole creates a magnetic field and that field in turn imparts magnetic forces on other particles that are in the fields
maxwell's equations which simplify to the biotsavart law in the case of steady currents describe the origin and behavior of the fields that govern these forces therefore magnetism is seen whenever electrically charged particles are in motionfor example from movement of electrons in an electric current or in certain cases from the orbital motion of electrons around an atom's nucleus they also arise from intrinsic magnetic dipoles arising from quantum-mechanical spin
the same situations that create magnetic fieldscharge moving in a current or in an atom and intrinsic magnetic dipolesare also the situations in which a magnetic field has an effect creating a force following is the formula for moving charge for the forces on an intrinsic dipole see magnetic dipole
when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field b it feels a lorentz force f given by the cross product
where
is the electric charge of the particle and
v is the velocity vector of the particle
because this is a cross product the force is perpendicular to both the motion of the particle and the magnetic field it follows that the magnetic force does no work on the particle it may change the direction of the particle's movement but it cannot cause it to speed up or slow down the magnitude of the force is
where is the angle between v and b
one tool for determining the direction of the velocity vector of a moving charge the magnetic field and the force exerted is labeling the index finger v the middle finger b and the thumb f with your right hand when making a gun-like configuration with the middle finger crossing under the index finger the fingers represent the velocity vector magnetic field vector and force vector respectively see also right hand rule
== magnetic dipolesedit ==
a very common source of magnetic field shown in nature is a dipole with a south pole and a north pole terms dating back to the use of magnets as compasses interacting with the earth's magnetic field to indicate north and south on the globe since opposite ends of magnets are attracted the north pole of a magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet the earth's north magnetic pole (currently in the arctic ocean north of canada) is physically a south pole as it attracts the north pole of a compass a magnetic field contains energy and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy when diamagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field a magnetic dipole tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field thereby lowering the net field strength when ferromagnetic material is placed within a magnetic field the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains
=== magnetic monopolesedit ===
since a bar magnet gets its ferromagnetism from electrons distributed evenly throughout the bar when a bar magnet is cut in half each of the resulting pieces is a smaller bar magnet even though a magnet is said to have a north pole and a south pole these two poles cannot be separated from each other a monopoleif such a thing existswould be a new and fundamentally different kind of magnetic object it would act as an isolated north pole not attached to a south pole or vice versa monopoles would carry magnetic charge analogous to electric charge despite systematic searches since 1931 as of 2010 they have never been observed and could very well not exist
nevertheless some theoretical physics models predict the existence of these magnetic monopoles paul dirac observed in 1931 that because electricity and magnetism show a certain symmetry just as quantum theory predicts that individual positive or negative electric charges can be observed without the opposing charge isolated south or north magnetic poles should be observable using quantum theory dirac showed that if magnetic monopoles exist then one could explain the quantization of electric chargethat is why the observed elementary particles carry charges that are multiples of the charge of the electron
certain grand unified theories predict the existence of monopoles which unlike elementary particles are solitons (localized energy packets) the initial results of using these models to estimate the number of monopoles created in the big bang contradicted cosmological observationsthe monopoles would have been so plentiful and massive that they would have long since halted the expansion of the universe however the idea of inflation (for which this problem served as a partial motivation) was successful in solving this problem creating models in which monopoles existed but were rare enough to be consistent with current observations
== quantum-mechanical origin of magnetismedit ==
in principle all kinds of magnetism originate (similar to superconductivity) from specific quantum-mechanical phenomena (e.g mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics in particular the chapters on spin and on the pauli principle) a successful model was developed already in 1927 by walter heitler and fritz london who derived quantum-mechanically how hydrogen molecules are formed from hydrogen atoms i.e from the atomic hydrogen orbitals and centered at the nuclei a and b see below that this leads to magnetism is not at all obvious but will be explained in the following
according to the heitler-london theory so-called two-body molecular -orbitals are formed namely the resulting orbital is
here the last product means that a first electron r1 is in an atomic hydrogen-orbital centered at the second nucleus whereas the second electron runs around the first nucleus this exchange phenomenon is an expression for the quantum-mechanical property that particles with identical properties cannot be distinguished it is specific not only for the formation of chemical bonds but as we will see also for magnetism i.e in this connection the term exchange interaction arises a term which is essential for the origin of magnetism and which is stronger roughly by factors 100 and even by 1000 than the energies arising from the electrodynamic dipole-dipole interaction
as for the spin function  which is responsible for the magnetism we have the already mentioned pauli's principle namely that a symmetric orbital (i.e with the + sign as above) must be multiplied with an antisymmetric spin function (i.e with a sign) and vice versa thus
i.e. not only and must be substituted by and  respectively (the first entity means spin up the second one spin down") but also the sign + by the sign and finally ri by the discrete values si (= ) thereby we have and  the singlet state i.e the sign means the spins are antiparallel i.e for the solid we have antiferromagnetism and for two-atomic molecules one has diamagnetism the tendency to form a (homoeopolar) chemical bond (this means the formation of a symmetric molecular orbital i.e with the + sign) results through the pauli principle automatically in an antisymmetric spin state (i.e with the sign) in contrast the coulomb repulsion of the electrons i.e the tendency that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion would lead to an antisymmetric orbital function (i.e with the sign) of these two particles and complementary to a symmetric spin function (i.e with the + sign one of the so-called triplet functions") thus now the spins would be parallel (ferromagnetism in a solid paramagnetism in two-atomic gases)
the last-mentioned tendency dominates in the metals iron cobalt and nickel and in some rare earths which are ferromagnetic most of the other metals where the first-mentioned tendency dominates are nonmagnetic (e.g sodium aluminium and magnesium) or antiferromagnetic (e.g manganese) diatomic gases are also almost exclusively diamagnetic and not paramagnetic however the oxygen molecule because of the involvement of -orbitals is an exception important for the life-sciences
the heitler-london considerations can be generalized to the heisenberg model of magnetism (heisenberg 1928)
the explanation of the phenomena is thus essentially based on all subtleties of quantum mechanics whereas the electrodynamics covers mainly the phenomenology
