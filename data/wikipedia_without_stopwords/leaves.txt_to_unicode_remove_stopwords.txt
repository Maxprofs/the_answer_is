general characteristics leaves
typically leaves broad flat thin thereby maximising surface area directly exposed light promoting photosynthetic function arranged plant expose surfaces light efficiently possible without shading many exceptions complications instance plants adapted windy conditions may pendent leaves many willows eucalyptus
internal organisation kinds leaves evolved maximise exposure photosynthetic organelles chloroplasts light increase absorption carbon dioxide gas exchange controlled stomata open close regulate exchange carbon dioxide oxygen water vapour atmosphere given square centimeter plant leaf may stomata
leaf forms adapted modulate amount light absorb avoid mitigate excessive heat ultraviolet damage desiccation sacrifice lightabsorption efficiency favour protection herbivory xerophytes major constraint light flux intensity drought window plants fenestraria species haworthia species haworthia tesselata haworthia truncata examples xerophytes bulbine mesembryanthemoides
shape structure leaves vary considerably species species plant depending largely adaptation climate available light also factors grazing animals deer available nutrients ecological competition plants considerable changes leaf type occur within species example plant matures case point eucalyptus species commonly isobilateral pendent leaves mature dominating neighbours however trees tend erect horizontal dorsiventral leaves seedlings growth limited available light factors include need balance water loss high temperature low humidity need absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide plants leaves also primary organs responsible transpiration guttation beads fluid forming leaf margins
leaves also store food water modified accordingly meet functions example leaves succulent plants bulb scales concentration photosynthetic structures leaves requires richer protein minerals sugars say woody stem tissues accordingly leaves prominent diet many animals true humans leaf vegetables commonly food staples
correspondingly leaves represent heavy investment part plants bearing retention disposition subject elaborate strategies dealing pest pressures seasonal conditions protective measures growth thorns production phytoliths lignins tannins poisons
deciduous plants frigid cold temperate regions typically shed leaves autumn whereas areas severe dry season plants may shed leaves dry season ends either case shed leaves may expected contribute retained nutrients soil fall
contrast many nonseasonal plants palms conifers retain leaves long periods welwitschia retains two main leaves throughout lifetime may exceed thousand years

anatomy
mediumscale features
leaves normally extensively vascularised typically networks vascular bundles containing xylem supplies water photosynthesis phloem transports sugars produced photosynthesis many leaves covered trichomes small hairs diverse structures functions
smallscale features
major tissue systems present
epidermis covers upper lower surfaces
mesophyll tissue inside leaf rich chloroplasts also called chlorenchyma
arrangement veins vascular tissue
three tissue systems typically form regular organisation cellular scale specialised cells differ markedly surrounding cells often synthesise specialised products crystals termed idioblasts
major leaf tissues
epidermis
epidermis outer layer cells covering leaf covered waxy cuticle impermeable liquid water water vapor forms boundary separating plants inner cells external world cuticle cases thinner lower epidermis upper epidermis generally thicker leaves dry climates compared wet climates epidermis serves several functions protection water loss way transpiration regulation gas exchange secretion metabolic compounds species absorption water leaves show dorsoventral anatomy upper adaxial lower abaxial surfaces somewhat different construction may serve different functions
epidermis tissue includes several differentiated cell types epidermal cells epidermal hair cells trichomes cells stomatal complex guard cells subsidiary cells epidermal cells numerous largest least specialized form majority epidermis typically elongated leaves monocots dicots
chloroplasts generally absent epidermal cells exception guard cells stomata stomatal pores perforate epidermis surrounded side chloroplastcontaining guard cells two four subsidiary cells lack chloroplasts forming specialized cell group known stomatal complex opening closing stomatal aperture controlled stomatal complex regulates exchange gases water vapor outside air interior leaf stomata therefore play important role allowing photosynthesis without letting leaf dry typical leaf stomata numerous abaxial lower epidermis adaxial upper epidermis numerous plants cooler climates
mesophyll
interior leaf upper lower layers epidermis parenchyma ground tissue chlorenchyma tissue called mesophyll greek middle leaf assimilation tissue primary location photosynthesis plant products photosynthesis called assimilates
ferns flowering plants mesophyll divided two layers
upper palisade layer vertically elongated cells one two cells thick directly beneath adaxial epidermis intercellular air spaces cells contain many chloroplasts spongy layer long cylindrical cells regularly arranged one five rows cylindrical cells chloroplasts close walls cell take optimal advantage light slight separation cells provides maximum absorption carbon dioxide separation must minimal afford capillary action water distribution order adapt different environment sun shade plants adapt structure obtain optimal result sun leaves multilayered palisade layer shade leaves older leaves closer soil singlelayered
beneath palisade layer spongy layer cells spongy layer branched tightly packed large intercellular air spaces oxygen carbon dioxide diffuse respiration photosynthesis cells contain fewer chloroplasts palisade layer pores stomata epidermis open substomatal chambers connected air spaces spongy layer cells
leaves normally green due chlorophyll chloroplasts chlorenchyma cells plants lack chlorophyll cannot photosynthesize
veins
veins vascular tissue leaf located spongy layer mesophyll pattern veins called venation angiosperms venation typically parallel monocotyledons forms interconnecting network broadleaved plants thought typical examples pattern formation ramification may instead exemplify pattern formed stress tensor field
vein made vascular bundle core bundle clusters two distinct types conducting cells
xylem cells bring water minerals roots leaf
phloem cells usually move sap dissolved sucrose produced photosynthesis leaf leaf
sheath ground tissue made lignin surrounding vascular tissue sheath mechanical role strengthening rigidity leaf
xylem typically lies adaxial side vascular bundle phloem typically lies abaxial side embedded dense parenchyma tissue called sheath usually includes structural collenchyma tissue

adaptations
course evolution leaves adapted different environments following ways
certain surface structure avoids moistening rain contamination see lotus effect
sliced leaves reduce wind resistance
hairs leaf surface trap humidity dry climates create boundary layer reducing water loss
waxy leaf surfaces reduce water loss
large surface area provides large area sunlight shade plant minimize heating reduce water loss
harmful levels sunlight specialised leaves opaque partly buried admit light translucent leaf window photosynthesis inner leaf surfaces eg fenestraria
succulent leaves store water organic acids use cam photosynthesis
aromatic oils poisons pheromones produced leaf borne glands deter herbivores eg eucalypts
inclusions crystalline minerals deter herbivores eg silica phytoliths grasses raphides araceae
petals attract pollinators
spines protect plants eg cacti
special leaves carnivorous plants adapted trapping food mainly invertebrate prey though species trap small vertebrates well see carnivorous plants
bulbs store food water eg onions
tendrils allow plant climb eg peas
bracts pseudanthia false flowers replace normal flower structures true flowers greatly reduced eg spurges
spathe
interactions organisms
although nutritious organs fruit leaves provide food source many organisms leaf vital source energy production plant plants evolved protection animals consume leaves tannins chemicals hinder digestion proteins unpleasant taste animals specialized eat leaves known folivores
species cryptic adaptations use leaves avoiding predators example caterpillars leafroller moths create small home leaf folding sawflies similarly roll leaves food plants tubes females attelabidae socalled leafrolling weevils lay eggs leaves roll means protection herbivores predators mimic appearance leaf reptiles chameleons insects katydids also mimic oscillating movements leaves wind moving side side back forth evading possible threat
