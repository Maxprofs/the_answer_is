spermatogenesis process spermatozoa produced male primordial sperm cells way mitosis meiosis initial cells pathway called spermatogonia yield primary spermatocytes mitosis primary spermatocyte divides meiotically meiosis two secondary spermatocytes secondary spermatocyte divides two spermatids meiosis ii develop mature spermatozoa also known sperm cells thus primary spermatocyte gives rise two cells secondary spermatocytes two secondary spermatocytes subdivision produce four spermatozoa
spermatozoa mature male gametes many sexually reproducing organisms thus spermatogenesis male version gametogenesis mammals occurs seminiferous tubules male testes stepwise fashion spermatogenesis highly dependent upon optimal conditions process occur correctly essential sexual reproduction dna methylation histone modification implicated regulation process starts puberty usually continues uninterrupted death although slight decrease discerned quantity produced sperm increase age see male infertility
purposeedit
spermatogenesis produces mature male gametes commonly called sperm specifically known spermatozoa able fertilize counterpart female gamete oocyte conception produce singlecelled individual known zygote cornerstone sexual reproduction involves two gametes contributing half normal set chromosomes haploid result chromosomally normal diploid zygote
preserve number chromosomes offspring differs species gamete must half usual number chromosomes present body cells otherwise offspring twice normal number chromosomes serious abnormalities may result humans chromosomal abnormalities arising incorrect spermatogenesis results congenital defects abnormal birth defects syndrome klinefelters syndrome cases spontaneous abortion developing fetus
locationedit
spermatogenesis takes place within several structures male reproductive system initial stages occur within testes progress epididymis developing gametes mature stored ejaculation seminiferous tubules testes starting point process stem cells adjacent inner tubule wall divide centripetal directionbeginning walls proceeding innermost part lumento produce immature sperm maturation occurs epididymis location testesscrotum specifically important process spermatogenesis requires lower temperature produce viable sperm specifically c lower normal body temperature c f clinically small fluctuations temperature athletic support strap causes impairment sperm viability count
durationedit
humans entire process spermatogenesis variously estimated taking days according tritiumlabelled biopsies approximately days according dna clock measurements including transport ductal system takes months testes produce million spermatozoa daily however half million become viable sperm
stagesedit
entire process spermatogenesis broken several distinct stages corresponding particular type cell human following table ploidy copy number chromosomechromatid counts one cell generally prior dna synthesis division g applicable primary spermatocyte arrested dna synthesis prior division
spermatocytogenesisedit
spermatocytogenesis male form gametocytogenesis results formation spermatocytes possessing half normal complement genetic material spermatocytogenesis diploid spermatogonium resides basal compartment seminiferous tubules divides mitotically producing two diploid intermediate cells called primary spermatocytes primary spermatocyte moves adluminal compartment seminiferous tubules duplicates dna subsequently undergoes meiosis produce two haploid secondary spermatocytes later divide haploid spermatids division implicates sources genetic variation random inclusion either parental chromosomes chromosomal crossover increase genetic variability gamete
cell division spermatogonium spermatid incomplete cells remain connected one another bridges cytoplasm allow synchronous development also noted spermatogonia divide produce spermatocytes otherwise supply spermatogonia would run instead certain types spermatogonia divide mitotically produce copies ensuring constant supply spermatogonia fuel spermatogenesis
spermatidogenesisedit
spermatidogenesis creation spermatids secondary spermatocytes secondary spermatocytes produced earlier rapidly enter meiosis ii divide produce haploid spermatids brevity stage means secondary spermatocytes rarely seen histological studies
spermiogenesisedit
spermiogenesis spermatids begin form tail growing microtubules one centrioles turns basal body microtubules form axoneme anterior part tail called midpiece thickens mitochondria arranged around axoneme ensure energy supply spermatid dna also undergoes packaging becoming highly condensed dna packaged firstly specific nuclear basic proteins subsequently replaced protamines spermatid elongation resultant tightly packed chromatin transcriptionally inactive golgi apparatus surrounds condensed nucleus becoming acrosome
maturation takes place influence testosterone removes remaining unnecessary cytoplasm organelles excess cytoplasm known residual bodies phagocytosed surrounding sertoli cells testes resulting spermatozoa mature lack motility rendering sterile mature spermatozoa released protective sertoli cells lumen seminiferous tubule process called spermiation
nonmotile spermatozoa transported epididymis testicular fluid secreted sertoli cells aid peristaltic contraction epididymis spermatozoa gain motility become capable fertilization however transport mature spermatozoa remainder male reproductive system achieved via muscle contraction rather spermatozoons recently acquired motility
role sertoli cellsedit
stages differentiation spermatogenic cells close contact sertoli cells thought provide structural metabolic support developing sperm cells single sertoli cell extends basement membrane lumen seminiferous tubule although cytoplasmic processes difficult distinguish light microscopic level
sertoli cells serve number functions spermatogenesis support developing gametes following ways
maintain environment necessary development maturation via bloodtestis barrier
secrete substances initiating meiosis
secrete supporting testicular fluid
secrete androgenbinding protein abp concentrates testosterone close proximity developing gametes
testosterone needed high quantities maintenance reproductive tract abp allows much higher level fertility
secrete hormones affecting pituitary gland control spermatogenesis particularly polypeptide hormone inhibin
phagocytose residual cytoplasm left spermiogenesis
secretion antimllerian hormone causes deterioration mllerian duct
protect spermatids immune system male via bloodtestis barrier
intercellular adhesion molecules icam soluble icam antagonistic effects tight junctions forming bloodtestis barrier icam molecules regulate spermatid adhesion apical side barrier towards lumen
influencing factorsedit
process spermatogenesis highly sensitive fluctuations environment particularly hormones temperature testosterone required large local concentrations maintain process achieved via binding testosterone androgen binding protein present seminiferous tubules testosterone produced interstitial cells also known leydig cells reside adjacent seminiferous tubules
seminiferous epithelium sensitive elevated temperature humans species adversely affected temperatures high normal body temperature consequently testes located outside body sack skin called scrotum optimal temperature maintained c man c mouse body temperature achieved regulation blood flow positioning towards away heat body cremasteric muscle dartos smooth muscle scrotum
dietary deficiencies vitamins b e anabolic steroids metals cadmium lead xray exposure dioxin alcohol infectious diseases also adversely affect rate spermatogenesis addition male germ line susceptible dna damage caused oxidative stress damage likely significant impact fertilization pregnancy exposure pesticides also affects spermatogenesis
hormonal controledit
hormonal control spermatogenesis varies among species humans mechanism completely understood however known initiation spermatogenesis occurs puberty due interaction hypothalamus pituitary gland leydig cells pituitary gland removed spermatogenesis still initiated follicle stimulating hormone fsh testosterone contrast fsh lh thought little role spermatogenesis outside inducing gonadal testosterone production
fsh stimulates production androgen binding protein abp sertoli cells formation bloodtestis barrier abp essential concentrating testosterone levels high enough initiate maintain spermatogenesis times higher concentration found blood fsh may initiate sequestering testosterone testes developed testosterone required maintain spermatogenesis however increasing levels fsh increase production spermatozoa preventing apoptosis type spermatogonia hormone inhibin acts decrease levels fsh studies rodent models suggest gonadotropins lh fsh support process spermatogenesis suppressing proapoptotic signals therefore promote spermatogenic cell survival
sertoli cells mediate parts spermatogenesis hormone production capable producing hormones estradiol inhibin leydig cells also capable producing estradiol addition main product testosterone estrogen found essential spermatogenesis although levels high also detrimental due suppression gonadotropin secretion intratesticular testosterone production prolactin also appears important spermatogenesis
