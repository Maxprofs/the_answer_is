bergeron classification air masses
bergeron classification widely accepted form air mass classification air mass classification involves three letters first letter describes moisture properties c used continental air masses dry m maritime air masses moist second letter describes thermal characteristic source region tropical p polar arctic antarctic m monsoon e equatorial superior air dry air formed significant upward motion atmosphere third letter used designate stability atmosphere air mass colder ground labeled k air mass warmer ground labeled w fronts separate air masses different types origins located along troughs lower pressure
surface weather analysis
surface weather analysis special type weather map provides view weather elements geographical area specified time based information groundbased weather stations weather maps created plotting tracing values relevant quantities sealevel pressure temperature cloud cover onto geographical map help find synoptic scale features weather fronts surface weather analyses special symbols show frontal systems cloud cover precipitation important information example h may represent high pressure implying fair weather l hand may represent low pressure frequently accompanies precipitation low pressure also creates surface winds deriving high pressure zones various symbols used frontal zones surface boundaries weather maps also depict present weather various locations weather map addition areas precipitation help determine frontal type location
front types
two different words used within meteorology describe weather around frontal zone term anafront describes boundaries show instability meaning air rises rapidly along boundary cause significant weather changes katafront weaker bringing smaller changes temperature moisture well limited rainfall
cold front
cold front located leading edge temperature drop isotherm analysis shows leading edge isotherm gradient normally lies within sharp surface trough cold fronts often bring heavy thunderstorms rain hail cold fronts produce sharper changes weather move twice quickly warm fronts since cold air denser warm air rapidly replaces warm air preceding boundary weather maps surface position cold front marked symbol blue line triangleshaped pips pointing direction travel placed leading edge cooler air mass cold fronts come association lowpressure area concept colder dense air wedging less dense warmer air often used depict air lifted along frontal boundary cold air wedging underneath warmer air creates strongest winds ground surface phenomenon often associated propertydamaging wind gusts lift would form narrow line showers thunderstorms enough moisture present however concept isnt accurate description physical processes upward motion produced warm air ramping cold dense air rather frontogenetical circulation behind upward forcing
warm front
warm fronts leading edge homogeneous warm air mass located equatorward edge gradient isotherms lie within broader troughs low pressure cold fronts warm front moves slowly cold front usually follows cold air denser harder remove earths surface also forces temperature differences across warm fronts broader scale clouds ahead warm front mostly stratiform rainfall gradually increases front approaches fog also occur preceding warm frontal passage clearing warming usually rapid frontal passage warm air mass unstable thunderstorms may embedded among stratiform clouds ahead front frontal passage thundershowers may continue weather maps surface location warm front marked red line semicircles pointing direction travel
occluded front
occluded front formed cold front overtakes warm front usually form around mature lowpressure areas cold warm fronts curve naturally poleward point occlusion also known triple point lies within sharp trough air mass behind boundary either warm cold cold occlusion air mass overtaking warm front cooler cool air ahead warm front plows air masses warm occlusion air mass overtaking warm front warmer cold air ahead warm front rides colder air mass lifting warm air
wide variety weather found along occluded front thunderstorms possible usually passage associated drying air mass within occlusion front circulation air brings warm air upward sends drafts cold air downward viceversa depending occlusion front experiencing precipitations clouds associated trowal projection earths surface tongue warm air aloft formed occlusion process depression
occluded fronts indicated weather map purple line alternating halfcircles triangles pointing direction travel trowal indicated series blue red junction lines
stationary front shearline
stationary front nonmoving stalled boundary two air masses neither strong enough replace tend remain essentially area extended periods time usually moving waves normally broad temperature gradient behind boundary widely spaced isotherm packing
wide variety weather found along stationary front usually clouds prolonged precipitation found stationary fronts either dissipate several days devolve shear lines transform cold warm front conditions aloft change stationary fronts marked weather maps alternating red halfcircles blue spikes pointing opposite directions indicating significant movement
stationary fronts become smaller scale degenerating narrow zone wind direction changes significantly relatively short distance become known shearlines shearline depicted line red dots dashes
dry line
similar phenomenon weather front dry line boundary air masses significant moisture differences westerlies increase north side surface highs areas lowered pressure form downwind northsouth oriented mountain chains leading formation lee trough near surface daylight hours warm moist air denser dry air greater temperature thus warm moist air wedges drier air like cold front higher altitudes warm moist air less dense dry air boundary slope reverses vicinity reversal aloft severe weather possible especially triple point formed cold front weaker form dry line seen commonly lee trough displays weaker differences moisture moisture pools along boundary warm season focus diurnal thunderstorms
dry line may occur anywhere earth regions intermediate desert areas warm seas southern plains west mississippi river united states particularly favored location dry line normally moves eastward day westward night dry line depicted national weather service nws surface analyses orange line scallops facing moist sector dry lines one surface fronts pips indicated necessarily reflect direction motion
squall line
organized areas thunderstorm activity reinforce preexisting frontal zones outrun cold fronts pattern upper level jet splits apart two streams resultant mesoscale convective system mcs forming point upper level split wind pattern running southeast warm sector parallel lowlevel thickness lines convection strong linear curved mcs called squall line feature placed leading edge significant wind shift pressure rise even weaker less organized areas thunderstorms lead locally cooler air higher pressures outflow boundaries exist ahead type activity act foci additional thunderstorm activity later day
features often depicted warm season across united states surface analyses lie within surface troughs outflow boundaries squall lines form arid regions haboob may result squall lines depicted nws surface analyses alternating pattern two red dots dash labelled sqln squall line outflow boundaries depicted troughs label outflow boundary
precipitation produced
fronts principal cause significant weather convective precipitation showers thundershowers related unstable weather caused air lifted condensing clouds movement cold front cold occlusion mass warmer moist air temperature differences two air masses involved large turbulence extreme wind shear presence strong jet stream roll clouds tornadoes may occur
warm season lee troughs breezes outflow boundaries occlusions lead convection enough moisture available orographic precipitation precipitation created lifting action air moving terrain mountains hills common behind cold fronts move mountainous areas may sometimes occur advance warm fronts moving northward east mountainous terrain however precipitation along warm fronts relatively steady rain drizzle fog sometimes extensive dense often occurs prewarmfrontal areas although fronts produce precipitation even clouds moisture must present air mass lifted
movement
fronts generally guided winds aloft move quickly cold fronts occluded fronts northern hemisphere usually travel northwest southeast warm fronts move poleward time northern hemisphere warm front moves southwest northeast southern hemisphere reverse true cold front usually moves southwest northeast warm front moves northwest southeast movement largely caused pressure gradient force horizontal differences atmospheric pressure coriolis effect caused earths spinning axis frontal zones slowed geographic features like mountains large bodies warm water
