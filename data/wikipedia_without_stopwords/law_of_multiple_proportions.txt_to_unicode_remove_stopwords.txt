chemistry law multiple proportions one basic laws stoichiometry used establish atomic theory alongside law conservation mass matter law definite proportions sometimes called daltons law discoverer british chemist john dalton published first part first volume new system chemical philosophy statement law
two elements form one compound ratios masses second element combine fixed mass first element ratios small whole numbers
example dalton knew element carbon forms two oxides combining oxygen different proportions fixed mass carbon say grams may react grams oxygen produce one oxide grams oxygen produce ratio masses oxygen react grams carbon ratio small whole numbers dalton interpreted result atomic theory proposing correctly case two oxides one two oxygen atoms respectively carbon atom modern notation first co carbon monoxide second co carbon dioxide
john dalton first expressed observation years previously french chemist joseph proust proposed law definite proportions expressed elements combined form compounds certain welldefined proportions rather mixing proportion antoine lavoisier proved law conservation mass helped dalton careful study actual numerical values proportions led dalton propose law multiple proportions important step toward atomic theory would propose later year laid basis chemical formulas compounds
another example law seen comparing ethane ch propane ch weight hydrogen combines g carbon g ethane g propane ratio weights expressed ratio two small numbers
limitations
law multiple proportions best demonstrated using simple compounds example one tried demonstrate using hydrocarbons decane chemical formula ch undecane ch one would find grams carbon could react grams hydrogen produce decane grams hydrogen produce undecane ratio hydrogen masses hardly ratio small whole numbers
law fails nonstoichiometric compounds also doesnt work well polymers oligomers
