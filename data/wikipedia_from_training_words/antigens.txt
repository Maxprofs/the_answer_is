in immunology tcr or bcr or its secreted form antibody in simpler terms an antigen is any substance that causes an immune system to produce antibodies against it each antibody is specifically selected after binding to a certain antigen because of random somatic diversification in the antibody complementarity determining regions a common analogy used to describe this is the fit between a lock and a key
in summary an antigen is a molecule that binds to ag-specific receptors but cannot induce an immune response in the body by itself the term originally described a structural molecule that binds specifically to an antibody it expanded to refer to any molecule or a linear molecular fragment that can be recognized by highly variable antigen receptors (b-cell receptor or t-cell receptor) of the adaptive immune system
the antigen may originate from within the body ("self-antigen") or from the external environment ("non-self") the immune system usually does not react to self-antigens under normal homeostatic conditions due to negative selection of t cells in the thymus and is supposed to identify and attack only non-self invaders from the outside world or modified/harmful substances present in the body under distressed conditions
antigen presenting cells present antigens in the form of peptides on histocompatibility molecules the t cells of the adaptive immune system recognize the antigens depending on the antigen and the type of the histocompatibility molecule different types of t cells activate for t-cell receptor (tcr) recognition the peptide must be processed into small fragments inside the cell and presented by a major histocompatibility complex (mhc) the antigen cannot elicit the immune response without the help of an immunologic adjuvant similarly the adjuvant component of vaccines plays an essential role in the activation of the innate immune system
an immunogen is a substance (or mixture) that is able to provoke a humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response it first initiates an innate immune response which causes the activation of the adaptive immune response an antigen binds the highly variable immunoreceptor products (b-cell receptor or t-cell receptor) once these have been generated all immunogenic molecules are also antigenic although the reverse is not true
at the molecular level an antigen can be characterized by its ability to bind to an antibody's variable fab region different antibodies have the potential to discriminate among specific epitopes present on the antigen surface hapten is a small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope in order to induce an immune response it has to be attached to a large carrier molecule such as a protein antigens are usually proteins and polysaccharides and less frequently lipids this includes parts (coats capsules cell walls flagella fimbrae and toxins) of bacteria viruses and other microorganisms lipids and nucleic acids are antigenic only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides non-microbial non-self antigens can include pollen egg white and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of transfused blood cells vaccines are examples of antigens in an immunogenic form which are intentionally administered to induce the memory function of adaptive immune system toward the antigens of the pathogen invading the recipient
== etymology ==
paul ehrlich coined the term antibody (in german antikrper) in his side-chain theory at the end of 19th century in 1899 ladislas deutsch (laszlo detre) (18741939) named the hypothetical substances halfway between bacterial constituents and antibodies substances immunogenes ou antigenes (antigenic or immunogenic substances) he originally believed those substances to be precursors of antibodies just as zymogen is a precursor of an enzyme but by 1903 he understood that an antigen induces the production of immune bodies (antibodies) and wrote that the word antigen is a contraction of antisomatogen (immunkrperbildner) the oxford english dictionary indicates that the logical construction should be anti(body)-gen
== terminology ==
epitope the distinct surface features of an antigen its antigenic determinant antigenic molecules normally large biological polymers usually present surface features that can act as points of interaction for specific antibodies any such feature constitutes an epitope most antigens have the potential to be bound by multiple antibodies each of which is specific to one of the antigen's epitopes using the lock and key metaphor the antigen can be seen as a string of keys (epitopes) each of which matches a different lock (antibody) different antibody idiotypes each have distinctly formed complementarity determining regions
allergen a substance capable of causing an allergic reaction the (detrimental) reaction may result after exposure via ingestion inhalation injection or contact with skin
superantigen a class of antigens that cause non-specific activation of t-cells resulting in polyclonal t cell activation and massive cytokine release
tolerogen a substance that invokes a specific immune non-responsive due to its molecular form if its molecular form is changed a tolerogen can become an immunogen
immunoglobulin-binding protein proteins such as protein a protein g and protein l that are capable of binding to antibodies at positions outside of the antigen-binding site while antigens are the target of antibodies immunoglobulin-binding proteins attack antibodies 
t-dependent antigen antigens that require the assistance of t cells to induce the formation of specific antibodies
t-independent antigen polysaccharides (usually) that stimulate b cells directly
immunodominant antigens antigens that dominate (over all others from a pathogen) in their ability to produce an immune response t cell responses typically are directed against a relatively few immunodominant epitopes although in some cases (e.g. infection with the malaria pathogen plasmodium spp.) it is dispersed over a relatively large number of parasite antigens
== sources ==
antigens can be classified according to their source
=== exogenous antigens ===
exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside for example by inhalation ingestion or injection the immune system's response to exogenous antigens is often subclinical by endocytosis or phagocytosis exogenous antigens are taken into the antigen-presenting cells (apcs) and processed into fragments apcs then present the fragments to t helper cells (cd4+) by the use of class ii histocompatibility molecules on their surface some t cells are specific for the peptide:mhc complex they become activated and start to secrete cytokines substances that activate cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctl) antibody-secreting b cells macrophages and other particles
some antigens start out as exogenous and later become endogenous (for example intracellular viruses) intracellular antigens can be returned to circulation upon the destruction of the infected cell
=== endogenous antigens ===
endogenous antigens are generated within normal cells as a result of normal cell metabolism or because of viral or intracellular bacterial infection the fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with mhc class i molecules if activated cytotoxic cd8+ t cells recognize them the t cells secrete various toxins that cause the lysis or apoptosis of the infected cell in order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting self-proteins the cytotoxic cells (self-reactive t cells) are deleted as a result of tolerance (negative selection) endogenous antigens include xenogenic (heterologous) autologous and idiotypic or allogenic (homologous) antigens
=== autoantigens ===
an autoantigen is usually a normal protein or protein complex (and sometimes dna or rna) that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from a specific autoimmune disease these antigens should not be under normal conditions the target of the immune system but their associated t cells are not deleted and instead attack
=== neoantigens ===
neoantigens are those that are entirely absent from the normal human genome as compared with nonmutated self-antigens neoantigens are of relevance to tumor control as the quality of the t cell pool that is available for these antigens is not affected by central t cell tolerance technology to systematically analyze t cell reactivity against neoantigens became available only recently
==== viral antigens ====
for virus-associated tumors such as cervical cancer and a subset of head and neck cancers epitopes derived from viral open reading frames contribute to the pool of neoantigens
==== tumor antigens ====
tumor antigens are those antigens that are presented by mhc i or mhc ii molecules on the surface of tumor cells antigens found only on such cells are called tumor-specific antigens (tsas) and generally result from a tumor-specific mutation more common are antigens that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells called tumor-associated antigens (taas) cytotoxic t lymphocytes that recognize these antigens may be able to destroy tumor cells
tumor antigens can appear on the surface of the tumor in the form of for example a mutated receptor in which case they are recognized by b cells
for human tumors without a viral etiology novel peptides (neo-epitopes) are created by tumor-specific dna alterations
===== process =====
a large fraction of human tumor mutations are effectively patient-specific therefore neoantigens may also be based on individual tumor genomes deep-sequencing technologies can identify mutations within the protein-coding part of the genome (the exome) and predict potential neoantigens in mice models for all novel protein sequences potential mhc-binding peptides were predicted the resulting set of potential neoantigens was used to assess t cell reactivity exomebased analyses were exploited in a clinical setting to assess reactivity in patients treated by either tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (til) cell therapy or checkpoint blockade neoantigen identification was successful for multiple experimental model systems and human malignancies
the false-negative rate of cancer exome sequencing is lowi.e. the majority of neoantigens occur within exonic sequence with sufficient coverage however the vast majority of mutations within expressed genes do not produce neoantigens that are recognized by autologous t cells
as of 2015 mass spectroscopy resolution is insufficient to exclude many false positives from the pool of peptides that may be presented by mhc molecules instead algorithms are used to identify the most likely candidates these algorithms consider factors such as the likelihood of proteasomal processing transport into the endoplasmic reticulum affinity for the relevant mhc class i alleles and gene expression or protein translation levels
the majority of human neoantigens identified in unbiased screens display a high predicted mhc binding affinity minor histocompatibility antigens a conceptually similar antigen class are also correctly identified by mhc binding algorithms another potential filter examines whether the mutation is expected to improve mhc binding the nature of the central tcr-exposed residues of mhc-bound peptides is associated with peptide immunogenicity
=== nativity ===
a native antigen is an antigen that is not yet processed by an apc to smaller parts t cells cannot bind native antigens but require that they be processed by apcs whereas b cells can be activated by native ones
== antigenic specificity ==
antigenic specificity is the ability of the host cells to recognize an antigen specifically as a unique molecular entity and distinguish it from another with exquisite precision antigen specificity is due primarily to the side-chain conformations of the antigen it is measurable and need not be linear or of a rate-limited step or equation
