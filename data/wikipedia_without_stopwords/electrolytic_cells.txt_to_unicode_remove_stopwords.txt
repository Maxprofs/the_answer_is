electrolytic cell electrochemical cell undergoes redox reaction electrical energy applied often used decompose chemical compounds process called electrolysisthe greek word lysis means break electrical energy added system chemical energy increased similarly galvanic cell electrolytic cells usually consist two half cells
important examples electrolysis decomposition water hydrogen oxygen bauxite aluminium chemicals electroplating eg copper silver nickel chromium performed using electrolytic cell
electrolytic cell three component parts electrolyte two electrodes cathode anode electrolyte usually solution water solvents ions dissolved molten salts sodium chloride also electrolytes driven external voltage applied electrodes ions electrolyte attracted electrode opposite charge chargetransferring also called faradaic redox reactions take place external electrical potential ie voltage correct polarity sufficient magnitude electrolytic cell decompose normally stable inert chemical compound solution electrical energy provided produce chemical reaction would occur spontaneously otherwise
galvanic cells compared electrolytic cellsedit
contrast shaft battery galvanic cell converts chemical energy electrical energy using spontaneous chemical reactions take place electrodes galvanic cell characteristic voltage defined energy release per electron transfer one electrode simple galvanic cell consist electrolyte two different electrodes galvanic cells also made connecting two halfcells electrode electrolyte iontransporting bridge usually salt bridge cells complex electrodes typically two metals naturally different reaction potentials relative electrolyte causes electrons one electrodes preferentially enter solution one electrode electrons leave solution electrode generates electric current across electrolyte charge carriers mobile ionic species drive electric current wire makes exterior connection electrodes galvanic cells electrolytic cells use electrodes different metals also use metal electrodes

anode cathode definitions depend charge dischargeedit
michael faraday defined cathode cell electrode cations positively charged ions like silver ions ag flow within cell reduced reacting electrons negatively charged electrode
likewise defined anode electrode anions negatively charged ions like chloride ions cl flow within cell oxidized depositing electrons electrode
external wire connected electrodes galvanic cell battery forming electric circuit cathode positive anode negative thus positive electric current flows cathode anode external circuit case galvanic cell
consider two voltaic cells unequal voltage mark positive negative electrodes one p n respectively place circuit p near p n near n cells tend drive current opposite directions cell larger voltage discharged making galvanic cell p cathode n anode described cell smaller voltage charges making electrolytic cell electrolytic cell negative ions driven towards p positive ions towards n thus p electrode electrolytic cell meets definition anode electrolytic cell charged similarly n electrode electrolytic cell cathode electrolytic cell charged
