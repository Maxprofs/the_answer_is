historically apparent motions planets first understood geometrically without regard gravity terms epicycles sums numerous circular motions theories kind predicted paths planets moderately well johannes kepler able show motions planets fact least approximately elliptical motions
geocentric model solar system celestial spheres model originally used explain apparent motion planets sky terms perfect spheres rings planets motions accurately measured theoretical mechanisms deferent epicycles added although capable accurately predicting planets position sky epicycles required time model became unwieldy
basis modern understanding orbits first formulated johannes kepler whose results summarised three laws planetary motion first found orbits planets solar system elliptical circular epicyclic previously believed sun located center orbits rather one focus second found orbital speed planet constant previously thought rather speed depends planets distance sun third kepler found universal relationship orbital properties planets orbiting sun planets cubes distances sun proportional squares orbital periods jupiter venus example respectively au distant sun orbital periods respectively years proportionality seen fact ratio jupiter practically equal venus accord relationship

orbital trajectories simply orbits
range elliptical paths closest point opposite firing point
circular path
range elliptical paths closest point firing point
open escape trajectories
parabolic paths
hyperbolic paths
worth noting actual rockets launched earth go vertically first get air causes frictional drag slowly pitch end firing rocket engine parallel atmosphere achieve orbit
orbits keep atmosphere eg elliptical orbit dips dense air object lose speed reenter ie fall occasionally space craft intentionally intercept atmosphere act commonly referred aerobraking maneuver

following derives mathematically orbit newton would done start newtonian law gravitational acceleration towards central body related inverse square distance
standard gravitational parameter case assume central body heavy enough considered stationary ignore subtle effects general relativity
pendulum object attached spring swings ellipse inward accelerationforce proportionate distance due way vectors add component force directions also proportionate respective components distances hence entire analysis done separately dimensions results harmonic parabolic equations ellipse decreasing relationship dimensions cannot separated
reason sun focal point orbits ellipse centre object moving really fast moves gravitational pull decreases allowing object almost escape quite escape orbit cycles around first parabola quite far away slowly circles back picks speed falls boomerang back space

use denote standard derivatives distance angle change time also take derivative vector see changes time subtracting location time time dividing result also vector basis vector moves object orbits start differentiating time vector keeps beginning origin rotates angle moves head distance perpendicular direction giving derivative
find velocity acceleration orbiting object
coefficients radial transverse components acceleration said newton gives first due gravity second zero
equation rearranged using integration parts
divide zero unless orbiting object crashes derivative zero gives function constant
actually theoretical proof keplers second law line joining planet sun sweeps equal areas equal intervals time constant integration h angular momentum per unit mass
order get equation orbit equation need eliminate time see also binet equation polar coordinates would express distance orbiting object center function angle however easier introduced auxiliary variable express function derivatives respect time may rewritten derivatives respect angle
reworking
plugging gives
gravitational force generally inverse square force law right hand side equation becomes constant equation seen harmonic equation shift origin dependent variable solution
