features
free body diagram meant scaled drawing diagram modified problem solved art flexibility process iconography free body diagram drawn also interpreted depends upon body modeled
free body diagrams consist
simplified version body
forces shown straight arrows pointing direction act body
moments shown curved arrows pointing direction act body
coordinate system
frequently reaction applied forces shown hash marks stem arrow
number forces moments shown free body diagram depends specific problem assumptions made common assumptions neglecting air resistance friction assuming rigid bodies statics forces moments must balance zero physical interpretation forces moments sum zero body motion principles statics apply therefore force shown free body diagram statics problem must least one opposing force known reaction dynamics resultant forces moments nonzero opposing forces necessary often present
modeling body
body may modeled three ways
particle model may used rotational effects zero interest even though body may extended body may represented small symbolic blob diagram reduces set concurrent arrows force particle bound vector
rigid extended stresses strains interest turning effects force arrow lie along line force along line irrelevant force extended rigid body sliding vector
nonrigid extended point application force becomes crucial indicated diagram force nonrigid body bound vector use tail arrow indicate point application others use tip
example body free fall
consider body free fall uniform gravitational field body may
particle enough show single vertically downward pointing arrow attached blob
rigid extended single arrow suffices represent weight w even though gravitational attraction acts every particle body arrow must lie along line centre gravity exactly along line arrow lie matter convenience popular choice locate arrow centre gravity strictly speaking need rigid body analysis see figure
nonrigid extended nonrigid analysis would error associate single point application gravitational force
included
fbd represents body interest external forces reactions keep body equilibrium
body usually sketched schematic way depending body particleextended rigidnonrigid questions answered thus rotation body torque consideration indication size shape body needed example brake dive motorcycle cannot found single point sketch finite dimensions required
external forces indicated labelled arrows fully solved problem force arrow capable indicating
direction line action
magnitude
point application
reaction opposed applied load hash present arrow
typically however provisional free body sketch drawn things known whole point diagram help determine things thus force arrow originally drawn length may meant indicate unknown magnitude line may correspond exact line action even direction may turn wrong often original direction arrow may directly opposite true direction engineer may also omit forces altogether especially rigid body analysis paired forces cancel
forces acting object include friction gravity normal force drag tension human force due pushing pulling noninertial reference frame fictitious forces centrifugal pseudoforce may appropriate
coordinate system sometimes included according convenience may make defining vectors simpler writing equations motion x direction might chosen point ramp inclined plane problem example case friction force x component normal force y component force gravity still components x y direction mgsin x mgcos y angle ramp horizontal
exclusions
things free body diagram explicitly excludes although sketches include things may helpful visualizing problem proper free body diagram show
bodies free body
constraints
body free constraints constraints replaced forces moments exert body
forces exerted free body
diagram showing forces exerted body likely confusing since forces cancel newtons rd law body exerts force body b b exerts equal opposite force confused equal opposite forces necessary hold body equilibrium
internal forces
example entire truss analyzed forces individual truss members included
velocity acceleration vectors
analysis
free body diagram analyzed summing forces often accomplished summing forces axis directions net force zero body must rest constant velocity newtons first law net force zero body accelerating direction newtons second law
angled forces
determining sum forces straightforward linear perpendicular diagrams axes somewhat complex forces angles often convenient analyze components forces case symbols fx fy used instead f forces point angle diagrams coordinate axis broken two parts three three dimensional problemseach part directed along one axeshorizontally fx vertically fy
example block inclined plane
simple free body diagram shown block ramp illustrates
external supports structures replaced forces generate include
mg product mass block constant gravitation acceleration weight
n normal force ramp
ff friction force ramp
force vectors show direction point application labeled magnitude
contains coordinate system used describing vectors
care needed interpreting diagram line action normal force shown midpoint base true location found sufficient data given diagram stands would need modified told block equilibrium
potential difficulty also arrow representing friction engineer drew diagram used tip arrow indicate point application force see force arrows diagram tip friction arrow highest point base intention however indicate friction acts point engineer instance assumed rigid body scenario friction force sliding vector thus point application relevant engineer tried indicate friction acts along whole base drawing arrow along base artistic ploys matter personal choice
