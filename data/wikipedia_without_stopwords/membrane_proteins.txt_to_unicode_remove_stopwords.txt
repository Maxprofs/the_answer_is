function
membrane proteins perform variety functions vital survival organisms
membrane receptor proteins relay signals cells internal external environments
transport proteins move molecules ions across membrane categorized according transporter classification database
membrane enzymes may many activities oxidoreductase transferase hydrolase
cell adhesion molecules allow cells identify interact example proteins involved immune response
topology
topology integral membrane protein describes number transmembrane segments well orientation membrane membrane proteins several different topologies
slightly different classification divide membrane proteins integral amphitropic amphitropic proteins exist two alternative states watersoluble lipid bilayerbound amphitropic protein category includes watersoluble channelforming polypeptide toxins associate irreversibly membranes excludes peripheral proteins interact membrane proteins rather lipid bilayer
integral membrane proteins
integral membrane proteins permanently attached membrane proteins separated biological membranes using detergents nonpolar solvents sometimes denaturing agents classified according relationship bilayer
integral polytopic proteins also known transmembrane proteins integral membrane proteins span across membrane least one two tertiary structures
helix bundle proteins present types biological membranes
beta barrel proteins found outer membranes gramnegative bacteria lipidrich cell walls grampositive bacteria outer membranes mitochondria chloroplasts
integral monotopic proteins integral membrane proteins attached one side membrane span whole way across
peripheral membrane proteins
peripheral membrane proteins temporarily attached either lipid bilayer integral proteins combination hydrophobic electrostatic noncovalent interactions peripheral proteins dissociate following treatment polar reagent solution elevated ph high salt concentrations
integral peripheral proteins may posttranslationally modified added fatty acid prenyl chains gpi glycosylphosphatidylinositol may anchored lipid bilayer
polypeptide toxins
polypeptide toxins many antibacterial peptides colicins hemolysins certain proteins involved apoptosis sometimes considered separate category proteins watersoluble aggregate associate irreversibly lipid bilayer become reversibly irreversibly membraneassociated
