variation exists within populations organisms occurs partly random mutations arise genome individual organism mutations passed offspring throughout individuals lives genomes interact environments cause variations traits environment genome includes molecular biology cell cells individuals populations species well abiotic environment individuals certain variants trait may survive reproduce individuals less successful variants therefore population evolves factors affect reproductive success also important issue darwin developed ideas sexual selection redefined included natural selection biologists considered important fecundity selection example
natural selection acts phenotype observable characteristics organism genetic heritable basis phenotype gives reproductive advantage may become common population see allele frequency time process result populations specialise particular ecological niches microevolution may eventually result emergence new species macroevolution words natural selection important process though process evolution takes place within population organisms natural selection contrasted artificial selection humans intentionally choose specific traits although may always get want natural selection intentional choice words artificial selection teleological natural selection teleological
natural selection one cornerstones modern biology concept published darwin alfred russel wallace joint presentation papers set darwins influential book origin species natural selection described analogous artificial selection process animals plants traits considered desirable human breeders systematically favoured reproduction concept natural selection originally developed absence valid theory heredity time darwins writing nothing known modern genetics union traditional darwinian evolution subsequent discoveries classical molecular genetics termed modern evolutionary synthesis natural selection remains primary explanation adaptive evolution
general principles
natural variation occurs among individuals population organisms many differences affect survival reproduction differences may improve chances survival reproduction particular individual rabbit runs faster others may likely escape predators algae efficient extracting energy sunlight grow faster something increases organisms chances survival often also include reproductive rate however sometimes tradeoff survival current reproduction ultimately matters total lifetime reproduction organism
peppered moth exists light dark colours united kingdom industrial revolution many trees moths rested became blackened soot giving darkcoloured moths advantage hiding predators gave darkcoloured moths better chance surviving produce darkcoloured offspring fifty years first dark moth caught nearly moths industrial manchester dark balance reversed effect clean air act dark moths became rare demonstrating influence natural selection peppered moth evolution
traits give individuals reproductive advantage also heritable passed parent offspring slightly higher proportion fast rabbits efficient algae next generation known differential reproduction even reproductive advantage slight many generations heritable advantage become dominant population way natural environment organism selects traits confer reproductive advantage causing gradual changes evolution life effect first described named charles darwin
concept natural selection predates understanding genetics mechanism heredity known life forms modern terms selection acts organisms phenotype observable characteristics organisms genetic makeup genotype inherited phenotype result genotype environment organism lives see genotypephenotype distinction
link natural selection genetics described modern evolutionary synthesis although complete theory evolution also requires account genetic variation arises first place mutation sexual reproduction includes evolutionary mechanisms genetic drift gene flow natural selection appears important mechanism creating complex adaptations nature
nomenclature usage
term natural selection slightly different definitions different contexts often defined operate heritable traits traits directly participate evolution however natural selection blind sense changes phenotype physical behavioural characteristics give reproductive advantage regardless whether trait heritable non heritable traits result environmental factors life experience organism
following darwins primary usage term often used refer evolutionary consequence blind selection mechanisms sometimes helpful explicitly distinguish selections mechanisms effects distinction important scientists define natural selection specifically mechanisms contribute selection individuals reproduce without regard whether basis selection heritable sometimes referred phenotypic natural selection
traits cause greater reproductive success organism said selected whereas reduce success selected selection trait may also result selection correlated traits directly influence reproductive advantage may occur result pleiotropy gene linkage
fitness
concept fitness central natural selection broad terms individuals fit better potential survival wellknown phrase survival fittest however natural selection precise meaning term much subtle modern evolutionary theory defines fitness long organism lives successful reproducing organism lives half long others species twice many offspring surviving adulthood genes become common adult population next generation
though natural selection acts individuals effects chance mean fitness really defined average individuals within population fitness particular genotype corresponds average effect individuals genotype lowfitness genotypes cause bearers offspring average examples include many human genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis
since fitness averaged quantity also possible favourable mutation arises individual survive adulthood unrelated reasons fitness also depends crucially upon environment conditions like sicklecell anaemia may low fitness general human population sickle cell trait confers immunity malaria high fitness value populations high malaria infection rates
types selection
natural selection act heritable phenotypic trait selective pressure produced aspect environment including sexual selection competition members species however imply natural selection always directional results adaptive evolution natural selection often results maintenance status quo eliminating less fit variants
selection classified according effect trait stabilizing selection acts hold trait stable optimum simplest case deviations optimum selectively disadvantageous directional selection acts transition periods current mode trait suboptimal alters trait towards single new optimum disruptive selection also acts transition periods current mode suboptimal alters trait one direction particular trait quantitative univariate higher lower trait levels favoured disruptive selection precursor speciation
selection also classified according effect allele frequency positive selection acts increase frequency allele negative selection acts decrease frequency allele note diallelic locus positive selection one allele perforce implies negative selection allele
selection also classified according effect genetic diversity purifying selection acts remove genetic variation population opposed de novo mutation introduces new variation balancing selection acts maintain genetic variation population even absence de novo mutation mechanisms include negative frequencydependent selection heterozygote advantage special case spatial andor temporal fluctuations strength direction selection
selection also classified according stage organisms life cycle acts use terminology differs recognise two types selection viability selection survival selection acts improve probability survival organism fecundity selection fertility selection reproductive selection acts improve rate reproduction given successful survival others split life cycle components selection see figure thus viability survival selection may defined separately respectively acting improve probability survival reproductive age reached fecundity selection may split additional subcomponents including sexual selection gametic selection acting gamete survival compatibility selection acting zygote formation
selection also classified according level unit selection individual selection acts level individual sense adaptions benefit individual result selection among individuals gene selection acts directly level gene many situations simply different way describing individual selection however cases eg kin selection intragenomic conflict genelevel selection provides apt explanation underlying process group selection acts level groups organisms mechanism assumes groups replicate mutate analogous way genes individuals ongoing debate degree group selection occurs nature
finally selection classified according resource competed sexual selection results competition mates sexual selection intrasexual cases competition among individuals sex population intersexual cases one sex controls reproductive access choosing among population available mates typically sexual selection proceeds via fecundity selection sometimes expense viability ecological selection natural selection via means sexual selection alternatively natural selection sometimes defined synonymous ecological selection sexual selection classified separate mechanism natural selection accords darwins usage terms ignores fact mate competition mate choice natural processes
note types selection often act concert thus stabilizing selection typically proceeds via negative selection rare alleles leading purifying selection directional selection typically proceeds via positive selection initially rare favoured allele
ecological selection covers mechanism selection result environment including relatives eg kin selection competition infanticide
sexual selection
sexual selection refers specifically competition mates intrasexual individuals sex malemale competition intersexual one gender choose mates however species exhibit sexrole reversed behaviour males selective mate choice fishes family syngnathidae though likely examples also found sexual selection amphibians sexual selection birds sexual selection mammals including sexual selection humans sexual selection scaled reptiles
phenotypic traits displayed one sex desired sex causing positive feedback loop called fisherian runaway example extravagant plumage male birds alternate theory proposed ronald fisher sexy son hypothesis mothers want promiscuous sons give large numbers grandchildren choose promiscuous fathers children aggression members sex sometimes associated distinctive features antlers stags used combat stags generally intrasexual selection often associated sexual dimorphism including differences body size males females species
examples natural selection
wellknown example natural selection action development antibiotic resistance microorganisms since discovery penicillin antibiotics used fight bacterial diseases natural populations bacteria contain among vast numbers individual members considerable variation genetic material primarily result mutations exposed antibiotics bacteria die quickly may mutations make slightly less susceptible exposure antibiotics short individuals survive treatment selective elimination maladapted individuals population natural selection
surviving bacteria reproduce producing next generation due elimination maladapted individuals past generation population contains bacteria resistance antibiotic time new mutations occur contributing new genetic variation existing genetic variation spontaneous mutations rare advantageous mutations even rarer however populations bacteria large enough individuals beneficial mutations new mutation reduces susceptibility antibiotic individuals likely survive next confronted antibiotic
given enough time repeated exposure antibiotic population antibioticresistant bacteria emerge new changed population antibioticresistant bacteria optimally adapted context evolved time necessarily optimally adapted old antibiotic free environment end result natural selection two populations optimally adapted specific environment perform substandard environment
widespread use misuse antibiotics resulted increased microbial resistance antibiotics clinical use point methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa described superbug threat poses health relative invulnerability existing drugs response strategies typically include use different stronger antibiotics however new strains mrsa recently emerged resistant even drugs
example known evolutionary arms race bacteria continue develop strains less susceptible antibiotics medical researchers continue develop new antibiotics kill similar situation occurs pesticide resistance plants insects arms races necessarily induced man welldocumented example involves spread gene butterfly hypolimnas bolina suppressing malekilling activity wolbachia bacteria parasites island samoa spread gene known occurred period five years
evolution means natural selection
prerequisite natural selection result adaptive evolution novel traits speciation presence heritable genetic variation results fitness differences genetic variation result mutations genetic recombinations alterations karyotype number shape size internal arrangement chromosomes changes might effect highly advantageous highly disadvantageous large effects rare past changes genetic material considered neutral close neutral occurred noncoding dna resulted synonymous substitution however recent research suggests many mutations noncoding dna slight deleterious effects although mutation rates average fitness effects mutations dependent organism estimates data humans found majority mutations slightly deleterious
definition fitness individuals greater fitness likely contribute offspring next generation individuals lesser fitness likely die early fail reproduce result alleles average result greater fitness become abundant next generation alleles general reduce fitness become rarer selection forces remain many generations beneficial alleles become abundant dominate population alleles lesser fitness disappear every generation new mutations recombinations arise spontaneously producing new spectrum phenotypes therefore new generation enriched increasing abundance alleles contribute traits favoured selection enhancing traits successive generations
mutations occur socalled regulatory genes changes large effects phenotype individual regulate function many genes mutations regulatory genes result nonviable zygotes examples nonlethal regulatory mutations occur hox genes humans result cervical rib polydactyly increase number fingers toes mutations result higher fitness natural selection favour phenotypes novel trait spread population
established traits immutable traits high fitness one environmental context may much less fit environmental conditions change absence natural selection preserve trait become variable deteriorate time possibly resulting vestigial manifestation trait also called evolutionary baggage many circumstances apparently vestigial structure may retain limited functionality may coopted advantageous traits phenomenon known preadaptation famous example vestigial structure eye blind molerat believed retain function photoperiod perception
speciation
speciation requires cessation gene flow results reproductive isolation time isolated subgroups might diverge radically become different species either differences selection pressures different subgroups different mutations arise spontaneously different populations genetic drift responsible phenomena bottleneck effect founder effect lesserknown mechanism speciation occurs via hybridisation welldocumented plants occasionally observed speciesrich groups animals cichlid fishes mechanisms rapid speciation reflect mechanism evolutionary change known punctuated equilibrium suggests evolutionary change particular speciation typically happens quickly interrupting long periods stasis
genetic changes within groups result increasing incompatibility genomes two subgroups thus reducing gene flow groups gene flow effectively cease distinctive mutations characterising subgroup become fixed two mutations result speciation mutation neutral positive effect fitness occur separately negative effect occur together fixation genes respective subgroups lead two reproductively isolated populations according biological species concept two different species

modern evolutionary synthesis
natural selection relies crucially idea heredity developed basic concepts genetics although moravian monk gregor mendel father modern genetics contemporary darwins work would lie obscurity early th century thcentury integration darwins theory evolution complex statistical appreciation gregor mendels rediscovered laws inheritance scientists generally come accept natural selection

genetic basis natural selection
idea natural selection predates understanding genetics much better idea biology underlying heritability basis natural selection
genotype phenotype
natural selection acts organisms phenotype physical characteristics phenotype determined organisms genetic makeup genotype environment organism lives often natural selection acts specific traits individual terms phenotype genotype used narrowly indicate specific traits
different organisms population possess different versions gene certain trait versions known allele genetic variation underlies phenotypic traits typical example certain combinations genes eye colour humans instance give rise phenotype blue eyes hand organisms population share allele particular trait state stable time allele said fixed population
traits governed single gene traits influenced interactions many genes variation one many genes contributes trait may small effect phenotype together genes produce continuum possible phenotypic values
directionality selection
component trait heritable selection alter frequencies different alleles variants gene produces variants trait selection divided three classes basis effect allele frequencies
directional selection occurs certain allele greater fitness others resulting increase frequency process continue allele fixed entire population shares fitter phenotype directional selection illustrated antibiotic resistance example
far common stabilizing selection commonly confused purifying selection lowers frequency alleles deleterious effect phenotype produce organisms lower fitness process continue allele eliminated population purifying selection results functional genetic features proteincoding genes regulatory sequences conserved time due selective pressure deleterious variants
finally number forms balancing selection exist result fixation maintain allele intermediate frequencies population occur diploid species homologous pairs chromosomes heterozygote individuals different alleles chromosome single genetic locus higher fitness homozygote individuals two alleles called heterozygote advantage overdominance bestknown example malarial resistance observed heterozygous humans carry one copy gene sicklecell anaemia maintenance allelic variation also occur disruptive diversifying selection favours genotypes depart average either direction opposite overdominance result bimodal distribution trait values finally balancing selection occur frequencydependent selection fitness one particular phenotype depends distribution phenotypes population principles game theory applied understand fitness distributions situations particularly study kin selection evolution reciprocal altruism
selection genetic variation
portion genetic variation functionally neutral produces phenotypic effect significant difference fitness hypothesis variation accounts large fraction observed genetic diversity known neutral theory molecular evolution originated motoo kimura genetic variation result differences fitness selection cannot directly affect frequency variation result genetic variation sites higher sites variation influence fitness however period new mutation genetic variation sites eliminated due genetic drift
mutationselection balance
natural selection results reduction genetic variation elimination maladapted individuals consequently mutations caused maladaptation time new mutations occur resulting mutationselection balance exact outcome two processes depends rate new mutations occur strength natural selection function unfavourable mutation proves consequently changes mutation rate selection pressure result different mutationselection balance
genetic linkage
genetic linkage occurs loci two alleles linked close proximity chromosome formation gametes recombination genetic material results reshuffling alleles however chance reshuffle occurs two alleles depends distance alleles closer alleles less likely reshuffle occur consequently selection targets one allele automatically results selection allele well mechanism selection strong influence patterns variation genome
selective sweeps occur allele becomes common population result positive selection prevalence one allele increases linked alleles also become common whether neutral even slightly deleterious called genetic hitchhiking strong selective sweep results region genome positively selected haplotype allele neighbours essence ones exist population
whether selective sweep occurred investigated measuring linkage disequilibrium whether given haplotype overrepresented population normally genetic recombination results reshuffling different alleles within haplotype none haplotypes dominate population however selective sweep selection specific allele also result selection neighbouring alleles therefore presence block strong linkage disequilibrium might indicate recent selective sweep near centre block used identify sites recently selection
background selection opposite selective sweep specific site experiences strong persistent purifying selection linked variation tend weeded along producing region genome low overall variability background selection result deleterious new mutations occur randomly haplotype produce clear blocks linkage disequilibrium although low recombination still lead slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall
competition
context natural selection competition interaction organisms species fitness one lowered presence another limited supply least one resource food water territory used factor competition within species important topic ecology especially community ecology competition one many interacting biotic abiotic factors affect community structure competition among members species known intraspecific competition competition individuals different species known interspecific competition competition always straightforward occur direct indirect fashion
according competitive exclusion principle species less suited compete resources either adapt die although competitive exclusion rarely found natural ecosystems according evolutionary theory competition within species resources plays relevant role natural selection however competition may play less role expansion among larger clades termed room roam hypothesis
