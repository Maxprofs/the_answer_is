vascular plants root organ plant typically lies surface soil however roots also aerial aerating growing ground especially water furthermore stem normally occurring ground exceptional either see rhizome therefore root best defined nonleaf nonnodes bearing parts plants body however important internal structural differences stems roots exist
first root comes plant called radicle four major functions roots absorption water inorganic nutrients anchoring plant body ground supporting storage food nutrients vegetative reproduction response concentration nutrients roots also synthesise cytokinin acts signal fast shoots grow roots often function storage food nutrients roots vascular plant species enter symbiosis certain fungi form mycorrhizae large range organisms including bacteria also closely associate roots
anatomy
dissected arrangement cells root root hair epidermis epiblem cortex endodermis pericycle lastly vascular tissue centre root transport water absorbed root places plant
root growth
early root growth one functions apical meristem located near tip root meristem cells less continuously divide producing meristem root cap cells sacrificed protect meristem undifferentiated root cells latter become primary tissues root first undergoing elongation process pushes root tip forward growing medium gradually cells differentiate mature specialized cells root tissues
correlation roots using process plant perception sense physical environment grow including sensory light physical barriers plant roots generally grow direction correct environment air mineral nutrients water exists meet plants needs roots shy shrink away dry poor soil conditions
time given right conditions roots crack foundations snap water lines lift sidewalks germination roots grow downward due gravitropism growth mechanism plants also causes shoot grow upward plants ivy root actually clings walls structures
growth apical meristems known primary growth encompasses elongation secondary growth encompasses growth diameter major component woody plant tissues many nonwoody plants example storage roots sweet potato secondary growth woody secondary growth occurs lateral meristems namely vascular cambium cork cambium former forms secondary xylem secondary phloem latter forms periderm
plants secondary growth vascular cambium originating xylem phloem forms cylinder tissue along stem root vascular cambium forms new cells inside outside cambium cylinder inside forming secondary xylem cells outside forming secondary phloem cells secondary xylem accumulates girth lateral dimensions stem root increases result tissues beyond secondary phloem including epidermis cortex many cases tend pushed outward eventually sloughed shed
point cork cambium begins form periderm consisting protective cork cells containing suberin roots cork cambium originates pericycle component vascular cylinder
vascular cambium produces new layers secondary xylem annually xylem vessels dead maturity responsible water transport vascular tissue stems roots
types roots
true root system consists primary root secondary roots lateral roots
diffuse root system primary root dominant whole root system fibrous branches directions common monocots main function fibrous root anchor plant
specialized roots
roots parts roots many plant species become specialized serve adaptive purposes besides two primary functions described introduction
adventitious roots arise outofsequence usual root formation branches primary root instead originate stem branches leaves old woody roots commonly occur monocots pteridophytes also many dicots clover trifolium ivy hedera strawberry fragaria willow salix aerial roots stilt roots adventitious conifers adventitious roots form largest part root system
aerating roots knee root knee pneumatophores cypress knee roots rising ground especially water mangrove genera avicennia sonneratia plants like avicennia erect roots large number breathing pores exchange gases
aerial roots roots entirely ground ivy hedera epiphytic orchids many aerial roots used receive water nutrient intake directly air fogs dew humidity air rely leave systems gather rain humidity even store scales pockets aerial roots mangrove aerial roots used aeration water absorption aerial roots used mainly structure functioning prop roots maize anchor roots trunk strangler fig epiphytes plants living surface plants aerial roots serve reaching water sources reaching surface functioning regular surface roots
contractile roots pull bulbs corms monocots hyacinth lily taproots dandelion deeper soil expanding radially contracting longitudinally wrinkled surface
coarse roots roots undergone secondary thickening woody structure roots ability absorb water nutrients main function transport provide structure connect smaller diameter fine roots rest plant
fine roots primary roots usually mm diameter function water nutrient uptake often heavily branched support mycorrhizas roots may short lived replaced plant ongoing process root turnover
haustorial roots roots parasitic plants absorb water nutrients another plant mistletoe viscum album dodder
propagative roots roots form adventitious buds develop aboveground shoots termed suckers form new plants canada thistle cherry many others
proteoid roots cluster roots dense clusters rootlets limited growth develop low phosphate low iron conditions proteaceae plants following families betulaceae casuarinaceae elaeagnaceae moraceae fabaceae myricaceae
stilt roots adventitious support roots common among mangroves grow lateral branches branching soil
storage roots roots modified storage food water carrots beets include taproots tuberous roots
structural roots large roots undergone considerable secondary thickening provide mechanical support woody plants trees
surface roots proliferate close soil surface exploiting water easily available nutrients conditions close optimum surface layers soil growth surface roots encouraged commonly become dominant roots
tuberous roots portion root swells food water storage eg sweet potato type storage root distinct taproot
rooting depths
distribution vascular plant roots within soil depends plant form spatial temporal availability water nutrients physical properties soil deepest roots generally found deserts temperate coniferous forests shallowest tundra boreal forest temperate grasslands deepest observed living root least metres ground surface observed excavation openpit mine arizona usa roots grow deep tree high majority roots plants however found relatively close surface nutrient availability aeration favourable growth rooting depth may physically restricted rock compacted soil close surface anaerobic soil conditions
rooting depth records
root architecture
simplest form term root architecture refers spatial configuration plants root system system extremely complex dependent upon multiple factors species plant composition soil availability nutrients root architecture plays important role providing secure supply nutrients water well anchorage support main terms used classify architecture root system
branch magnitude number links exterior interior
topology pattern branching including
herringbone alternate lateral branching parent root
dichotomous opposite forked branches
radial whorls branches around root
link length distance branches
root angle radial angle lateral roots base around parent roots circumference angle lateral root parent root angle entire system spreads
link radius diameter root
components regulated complex interaction genetic responses responses due environmental stimuli developmental stimuli categorised intrinsic genetic nutritional influences extrinsic environmental influences interpreted signal transduction pathways extrinsic factors affect root architecture include gravity light exposure water oxygen well availability lack thereof nitrogen phosphorus sulphur aluminium sodium chloride main hormones intrinsic stimuli respective pathways responsible root architecture development include
auxin auxin promotes root initiation root emergence primary root elongation
cytokinins cytokinins regulate root apical meristem size promote lateral root elongation
gibberellins together ethylene promote crown primordia growth elongation together auxin promote root elongation gibberellins also inhibit lateral root primordia initiation
ethylene ethylene promotes crown root formation
configuration root systems important support plant compete plants uptake nutrients soil roots grow specific conditions changed impede plants growth example root system developed dry soil may efficient flooded soil however plants still able adapt changes environment seasonal changes
certain plants namely fabaceae form root nodules order associate form symbiotic relationship nitrogenfixing bacteria called rhizobia due high energy required fix nitrogen atmosphere bacteria take carbon compounds plant fuel process return plant takes nitrogen compounds produced ammonia bacteria
tree roots usually grow three times diameter branch spread half lie underneath trunk canopy roots one side tree usually supply nutrients foliage side families however sapindaceae maple family show correlation root location root supplies nutrients plant
evolutionary history
fossil record roots rather infilled voids roots rotted death spans back late silurian identification difficult casts molds roots similar appearance animal burrows although discriminated basis range features
economic importance
term root crops refers edible underground plant structure many root crops actually stems potato tubers edible roots include cassava sweet potato beet carrot rutabaga turnip parsnip radish yam horseradish spices obtained roots include sassafras angelica sarsaparilla licorice
sugar beet important source sugar yam roots source estrogen compounds used birth control pills fish poison insecticide rotenone obtained roots lonchocarpus spp important medicines roots ginseng aconite ipecac gentian reserpine several legumes nitrogenfixing root nodules used green manure crops provide nitrogen fertilizer crops plowed specialized bald cypress roots termed knees sold souvenirs lamp bases carved folk art native americans used flexible roots white spruce basketry
tree roots heave destroy concrete sidewalks crush clog buried pipes aerial roots strangler fig damaged ancient mayan temples central america temple angkor wat cambodia
trees stabilize soil slope prone landslides root hairs work anchor soil
vegetative propagation plants via cuttings depends adventitious root formation hundreds millions plants propagated via cuttings annually including chrysanthemum poinsettia carnation ornamental shrubs many houseplants
roots also protect environment holding soil prevent soil erosion especially important areas sand dunes
