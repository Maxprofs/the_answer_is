an ecological pyramid (also trophic pyramid eltonian pyramid energy pyramid or sometimes food pyramid) is a graphical representation designed to show the biomass or bio productivity at each trophic level in a given ecosystem
biomass is the amount of living or organic matter present in an organism biomass pyramids show how much biomass is present in the organisms at each trophic level while productivity pyramids show the production or turnover in biomass
ecological pyramids begin with producers on the bottom (such as plants) and proceed through the various trophic levels (such as herbivores that eat plants then carnivores that eat herbivores then carnivores that eat those carnivores and so on) the highest level is the top of the food chain
an ecological pyramid of biomass shows the relationship between biomass and trophic level by quantifying the biomass present at each trophic level of an ecological community at a particular time it is a graphical representation of biomass (total amount of living or organic matter in an ecosystem) present in unit area in different tropic levels typical units are grams per meter2 or calories per meter2 the pyramid of biomass may be inverted for example in a pond ecosystem the standing crop of phytoplankton the major producers at any given point will be lower than the mass of the heterotrophs such as fish and insects this is explained as the phytoplankton reproduce very quickly but have much shorter individual lives
one problem with biomass pyramids is that they can make a trophic level appear to contain more energy than it actually does for example all birds have beaks and skeletons which despite having mass are not eaten by the next trophic level
there is also pyramid of numbers which represent the number of organisms in each trophic level they may be upright (e.g grassland ecosystem) inverted (parasitic ecosystem) or dumbbell shaped (forest ecosystem)

an ecological pyramid of productivity is often more useful showing the production or turnover of biomass at each trophic level instead of showing a single snapshot in time productivity pyramids show the flow of energy through the food chain typical units are grams per meter2 per year or calories per meter2 per year as with the others this graph shows producers at the bottom and higher trophic levels on top
when an ecosystem is healthy this graph produces a standard ecological pyramid this is because in order for the ecosystem to sustain itself there must be more energy at lower trophic levels than there is at higher trophic levels this allows organisms on the lower levels to not only to maintain a stable population but also to transfer energy up the pyramid the exception to this generalization is when portions of a food web are supported by inputs of resources from outside the local community in small forested streams for example the volume of higher levels is greater than could be supported by the local primary production
when energy is transferred to the next trophic level typically only 10% of it is used to build new biomass becoming stored energy (the rest going to metabolic processes) (pauly and christensen 1995) in this case in the pyramid of productivity each step will be 10% the size of the previous step (100,000 10,000 1,000 100 10 1 1 01)
the advantages of the pyramid of productivity as a representation
it takes account of the rate of production over a period of time
two species of comparable biomass may have very different life spans thus a direct comparison of their total biomasses is misleading but their productivity is directly comparable
the relative energy chain within an ecosystem can be compared using pyramids of energy also different ecosystems can be compared
there are no inverted pyramids
the input of solar energy can be added
the disadvantages of the pyramid of productivity as a representation
the rate of biomass production of an organism is required which involves measuring growth and reproduction through time
there is still the difficulty of assigning the organisms to a specific trophic level as well as the organisms in the food chains there is the problem of assigning the decomposers and detritivores to a particular trophic level
nonetheless productivity pyramids usually provide more insight into an ecological community when the necessary information is available
an ecological pyramid of numbers shows graphically the population of each level in a food chain
