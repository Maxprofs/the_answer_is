=== hopperedit ===
in march 2012 dish began offering a digital video recorder called dish hopper (dvr) that can automatically record all prime time programming on the four major television networks the dvr which costs $12 per month has three tuners and 2 tb of space half of which can be used to record 500 hours of high-definition television or 2000 hours of standard-definition television programs the other half is for video on demand a hopper feature called autohop enables customers to view these programs without commercials subject to time restrictions autohop has attracted enthusiasts critics boycotts and legal action at the 2013 consumer electronics show dish won an award for their autohop feature on the hopper
==== hopper with slingedit ====
at the 2013 consumer electronics show dish announced the hopper with sling an updated version of the hopper with slingbox place-shifting technology built-in allowing the ability to watch live tv and dvr recordings online or through a free dish anywhere mobile app and the ability to fling content from a mobile device (such as videos or photos) onto the tv as well a hopper transfers app for the ipad and android also allows recordings to be downloaded directly to the device for offline viewing and a new dish explorer app also provides control of the hopper along with integration with social networks to track trends and reactions to a program [ipad only] the new hopper also includes a 2 tb hard drive (allowing the storage of up to 2,000 hours of standard definition recordings and 500 hours in high definition) and a broadcom bcm7425 cpu
cnet praised the hopper with sling for being cutting-edge technology that helps dish make a strong case that its hd dvr is the most advanced out there. it subsequently nominated the new hopper for the ces best in show award (which was decided by cnet) and had won the award based off the original vote of cnet's staff however cnet's parent company cbs corporation vetoed the results disqualified the device and forced a re-vote because cbs was in active litigation with dish after complaints by critics (including consumer electronics association ceo gary shapiro) cnet was dropped as the organizer of the ces awards program and the best in show award was re-awarded to both the hopper with sling and the razer edge gaming tablet (which had won in the second vote by cnet)
=== sling tvedit ===
in may 2012 dish launched dishworlda subscription-based over-the-top iptv service as an app on roku devices offering access to over 50 international television channels via broadband streaming

on september 27 2012 dish network announced a satellite broadband service called dishnet aimed at rural areas to be launched on october 1
=== founding and early growthedit ===
dish network officially began operations on march 4 1996 as a service of echostar echostar a precursor to dish network was formed in 1980 by its chairman and chief executive officer charlie ergen along with colleagues candy ergen and jim defranco as a distributor of c band satellite television systems in 1987 echostar applied for a direct broadcast satellite broadcast license with the federal communications commission and was granted access to orbital slot 119 west longitude in 1992
on december 28 1995 echostar successfully launched its first satellite echostar i with this and the completion of the construction of the satellite uplink center in cheyenne wyoming the dish network brand name was born to represent the home satellite tv service in march 1996 the company made its first broadcast to customers
in 1998 echostar purchased the broadcasting assets of a satellite broadcasting joint venture of news corporation and mci worldcom called askyb (for american sky broadcasting named after news corp's bskyb service in britain) the two companies had nearly merged (which called for dish network being renamed sky) before it was called off due to charlie ergen's clashes with news corp executives with this purchase echostar obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110 west orbital slot more than doubling existing continental united states broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million some of the other assets were picked up by rival primestar which was sold to directv in 1999 the acquisition (which also included an uplink center in gilbert az) inspired the company to introduce a multisatellite system called dish 500 theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one dish in the same year echostar partnering with bell canada launched dish network canada
=== hd expansionedit ===
in january 1999 the company released the industry's first high-definition television (hdtv) tuner in august 2003 the company launched echostar ix the first satellite equipped with commercial ka band payload for broadband service over the united states this led the company in 2004 to be the first satellite tv service to offer local channels to all 50 states in that year the company also introduced the nation's first interactive tv multiple picture-in picture application for the olympic games offering coverage from multiple channels at once this year the company also acquired its 10 millionth customer
in january 2005 echostar bought the broadcasting assets of the troubled hdtv satellite provider voom including its rainbow 1 satellite co-located with echostar 3 at 61.5 west on april 29 echostar announced that it would expand its hdtv programming by adding the first 10 of 21 original voom channels and mirror the channels on a conus slot dish network added cnn hd in spanish along with other packages in its latino hd lineup
on january 1 2008 the company completed its spinoff of its technology and set-top box business into a separate publicly traded company echostar corporation ("echostar") effectively splitting the original echostar into two separate businesses dish network corporation the larger of the two resulting companies focuses on programming service and marketing of satellite television while echostar corporation runs a majority of the satellite fleet and other signal infrastructure while neither company has any ownership in the other the majority of the voting power of the shares in both companies is owned by charlie ergen
=== acquisitions and diversificationedit ===
in 2011 dish network spent over $3 billion in acquisitions of companies in bankruptcy which motley fool's anders bylund described as a veritable buying rampage in the bargain bin. this includes the april 6 2011 purchase of blockbuster inc in a bankruptcy auction in new york agreeing to pay $322 million in cash and assume $87 million in liabilities and other obligations for the nationwide video-rental company dish network also acquired the defunct companies dbsd and terrestar dish network also made a bid to purchase hulu on october 2011 but hulu's owners chose not to sell the company there was also speculation that dish network might purchase sprint nextel or clearwire in 2013 dish made a bid for both companies ceo charles ergen plans on adding wireless internet and mobile video services that can compete with netflix and cable companies about the new markets ergen said given the assets we've been accumulating i don't think it's hard to see we're moving in a different direction from simply pay-tv which is a market that's becoming increasingly saturated.
dish network put its blockbuster acquisition to work by making available dish movie pack for dish network subscribers and sling tv for non-dish network subscribers blockbuster also has agreements that allow it to receive movies 28 days before netflix and redbox which could encourage customers to use these services
dish network also plans on offering high-speed internet the company plans a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile broadband service in 2011 it petitioned the fcc to combine the s-band spectrum it acquired from dbsd and terrestar and combine this spectrum with lte unlike lightsquared dish's spectrum has minimal risk of disrupting global positioning systems
at the 2012 consumer electronics show dish network announced that they would be dropping the network and going solely by dish (along with a new logo) in their marketing dish network's parent company will remain dish network
after changing the position of a satellite orbital position from being over mexico to brazil in 2011 dish network sought companies that could make a deal among them telefnica however nothing ever came of this and dish decided to enter the country itself according to the brazilian agency of telecommunications (anatel) they await the authorization of the application
== technical informationedit ==
=== satellite dishesedit ===
dish network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by sanmina-sci corporation to echostar specifications prior to the december 2001 merger of sci systems and sanmina dish network receivers were produced at factories in huntsville alabama and fountain colorado currently receiver assembly takes place in guadalajara mexico and india
==== earlier satellite dishesedit ====
dish network's first satellite antenna was simply called the dish network dish it was retroactively named the dish 300 when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming dish 500 systems it uses one lnb to obtain signals from the 119w orbital location and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional high-definition or ethnic programming from either the 148w or 61.5w orbital locations the 119w slot is one of two primary orbital locations the other being 110w that provide core services
after echostar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between askyb and mci worldcom it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110w orbital location since echostar also owned the adjacent 119w orbital location it developed the dish 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative dual-lnb assembly although the new 20-inch dish 500 was slightly larger than the then-current 18-inch dish 300 and directv dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from echostar's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500-channel capacity the dish 500 as a result provided very large capacity for local-into-local service nationwide programming and business services in order to migrate existing customers to dish 500 dish network provides value-added channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the dish 500 and newer systems some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are h2 boomerang science planet green pbs kids sprout and comedy central
==== higher capacity satellite dishesedit ====
in spite of all this capacity echostar still needed to fulfill the dream of nationwide high-definition television and conceived the dish 1000 system to receive signals from 110w 119w and 129w orbital locations originally dish network high-definition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes currently dish network subscribers can receive nationwide hdtv channels using the 129w orbital location or 61.5w orbital location because of issues with low signal strength the older model dish 1000 has been replaced with the dish 1000.2 the 1000.2 has a 10% larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated lnb for easier installation the dish 1000.2 is 23 in (580 mm) in diameter even with the larger size there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the 129w orbital location this has forced some customers to either use a 2nd separate dish network brand dish or an aftermarket 30 dish aimed specifically at the 129w orbital location on several satellite related web support forums customers have critically suggested that the new dish 1000.2 wasn't nearly large enough and should have been 2030% larger to properly deal with rain fade later dish network took the approach of splitting the us into two regions subscribers west of chicago use dish 1000.2 antennas aimed at the 110w 119w and 129w orbital locations (referred to as the western arc) subscribers east of chicago use dish 1000.4 antennas aimed at the 61.5w 72w and 77w oribital locations (referred to as the eastern arc)
during dish network's quest for capacity they had accumulated an array of satellite broadcasting technologies orbital locations and surplus capacity using non-mainstream technologies requiring larger dish sizes to capitalize on these broadcasting assets dish network started providing extensive ethnic programming from lower-powered satellites broadcasting in the non-dbs portion of the fss band dish network offers specialized equipment for these customers including larger dish antennas
the superdish dish 500+ and dish 1000+ systems receive dbs signals from both of the primary 110w and 119w locations (129w for dish 1000+) as well as lower-powered fss signals from either 121w 105w or 118.75w the dish 500+ and 1000+ systems receive circularly polarized signals in the non-dbs portion of the fss bandthe only american satellite television service to do so
=== broadcast technologyedit ===
while for years dish network has used standard mpeg-2 for broadcasting the addition of bandwidth-intensive hdtv in a limited-bandwidth world has called for a change to an h.264/mpeg-4 avc system dish network announced as of february 1 2006 that all new hdtv channels would be available in h.264 format only while maintaining the current lineup as mpeg-2 dish network intends to eventually convert the entire platform to h.264 in order to provide more channels to subscribers in 2007 dish network reduced the resolution of 1080-line channels from 1920x1080 to 1440x1080 reducing horizontal resolution and/or data rate of hd video is known as hd lite and is practiced by other tv providers as well
both a standard receiver and a receiver with built-in digital video recorder (dvr) are available to subscribers the dish network vip722 hd dvr (record up to 350 hours of standard-definition (sd) up to 55 hours of high-definition (hd)) replacement to the vip622 has received generally positive reviews from cnet and others
both a standard receiver and a dvr (digital video recorder) are available to subscribers for an upgrade fee beginning in january 2010 dish network charges $7.00 as a dvr service fee which covers cost of licensing epg (electronic program guide) listings from rovi corporation with the tv guide logo displayed on listings screens to signify the partnership
=== satellite fleetedit ===
most of the satellites used by dish network are owned and operated by echostar since echostar frequently moves satellites among its many orbiting slots this list may not be immediately accurate refer to lyngsat and dish channel chart for detailed satellite information
== criticisms and controversiesedit ==
since the early 2000s dish network received criticism regarding controversial technology and carriage disputes with programming providers most notably when the hopper digital video recorder provided an easy way for viewers to watch certain programming without commercials major networks sued dish network
