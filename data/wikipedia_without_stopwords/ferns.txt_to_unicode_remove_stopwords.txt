life cycle
ferns vascular plants differing lycophytes true leaves megaphylls often pinnate differ seed plants gymnosperms angiosperms mode reproductionlacking flowers seeds like vascular plants life cycle referred alternation generations characterized alternating diploid sporophytic haploid gametophytic phases diploid sporophyte n paired chromosomes n varies species species haploid gametophyte n unpaired chromosomes ie half number sporophyte gametophyte ferns freeliving organism whereas gametophyte gymnosperms angiosperms dependent sporophyte
life cycle typical fern
diploid sporophyte phase produces haploid spores meiosis process cell division reduces number chromosomes half
spore grows haploid gametophyte mitosis process cell division maintains number chromosomes gametophyte typically consists photosynthetic prothallus
gametophyte produces gametes often sperm eggs prothallus mitosis
mobile flagellate sperm fertilizes egg remains attached prothallus
fertilized egg diploid zygote grows mitosis diploid sporophyte typical fern plant
morphology
like sporophytes seed plants ferns consist stems leaves roots
stems fern stems often referred rhizomes even though grow underground species epiphytic species many terrestrial ones aboveground creeping stolons eg polypodiaceae many groups aboveground erect semiwoody trunks eg cyatheaceae reach metres ft tall species eg cyathea brownii norfolk island cyathea medullaris new zealand
leaf green photosynthetic part plant technically megaphyll ferns often referred frond new leaves typically expand unrolling tight spiral called crozier fiddlehead fern uncurling leaf termed circinate vernation leaves divided two types trophophyll sporophyll trophophyll frond vegetative leaf analogous typical green leaves seed plants produce spores instead producing sugars photosynthesis sporophyll frond fertile leaf produces spores borne sporangia usually clustered form sori ferns fertile leaves morphologically similar sterile ones photosynthesize way groups fertile leaves much narrower sterile leaves may even green tissue eg blechnaceae lomariopsidaceae anatomy fern leaves either simple highly divided tree ferns main stalk connects leaf stem known stipe often multiple leafy leafy structures grow stipe known pinnae often divided smaller pinnules
roots underground nonphotosynthetic structures take water nutrients soil always fibrous structurally similar roots seed plants
gametophytes ferns however different seed plants instead resemble liverworts fern gametophyte typically consists
prothallus green photosynthetic structure one cell thick usually heart kidney shaped mm long mm broad prothallus produces gametes means
antheridia small spherical structures produce flagellate sperm
archegonia flaskshaped structure produces single egg bottom reached sperm swimming neck
rhizoids rootlike structures true roots consist single greatly elongated cells water mineral salts absorbed whole structure rhizoids anchor prothallus soil
one difference sporophytes gametophytes might summed saying nothing eats ferns everything eats gametophytes oversimplification true gametophytes often difficult find field far likely food sporophytes
evolution phylogeny classification
ferns first appear fossil record earlycarboniferous period triassic first evidence ferns related several modern families appeared great fern radiation occurred latecretaceous many modern families ferns first appeared
one problem fern classification problem cryptic species cryptic species species morphologically similar another species differs genetically ways prevent fertile interbreeding good example currently designated species asplenium trichomanes maidenhair spleenwort actually species complex includes distinct diploid tetraploid races minor unclear morphological differences two groups prefer distinctly differing habitats many cases species complexes separated separate species thus raising number overall fern species possibly many cryptic species yet discovered designated
ferns traditionally grouped class filices modern classifications assign phylum division plant kingdom called pteridophyta also known filicophyta group also referred polypodiophyta polypodiopsida treated subdivision tracheophyta vascular plants although polypodiopsida sometimes refers leptosporangiate ferns term pteridophyte traditionally used describe seedless vascular plants making synonymous ferns fern allies confusing since members fern phylum pteridophyta also sometimes referred pteridophytes
