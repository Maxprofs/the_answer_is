concept inventories use
concept inventories educationrelated diagnostic tests halloun hestenes introduced multiplechoice mechanics diagnostic test examine students concepts motion evaluates student understanding basic concepts classical macroscopic mechanics little later force concept inventory fci another concept inventory developed fci designed assess student understanding newtonian concepts force hestenes found nearly students completing introductory college physics courses could state newtons third law beginning course fci data showed less fully understood endthese results replicated number studies involving students range institutions see sources section said remains questions exactly fci measures results hake using fci led greater recognition science education community importance students interactive engagement materials mastered

caveats associated concept inventory use
concept inventories problematic concepts tested may fundamental important particular discipline concepts involved may explicitly taught class curriculum answering question correctly may require superficial understanding topic therefore possible either overestimate underestimate student content mastery concept inventories designed identify trends student thinking may useful monitoring learning gains result pedagogical interventions disciplinary mastery may variable measure particular instrument users careful ensure concept inventories actually testing conceptual understanding rather testtaking ability language skills abilities influence test performance
use multiplechoice exams concept inventories without controversy structure multiplechoice type concept inventories raises questions involving extent complex often nuanced situations ideas must simplified clarified produce unambiguous responses example multiplechoice exam designed assess knowledge key concepts natural selection meet number standards quality control one problem exam two members several pairs parallel items pair designed measure exactly one key concept natural selection sometimes different levels difficulty another problem multiplechoice exam overestimates knowledge natural selection reflected student performance diagnostic essay exam diagnostic oral exam two instruments reasonably good construct validity although scoring concept inventories form essay oral exams laborintensive costly difficult implement large numbers students exams offer realistic appraisal actual levels students conceptual mastery well misconceptions recently however computer technology developed score essay responses concept inventories biology domains nehm ha mayfield promising facilitate scoring concept inventories organized transcribed oral exams well essays
