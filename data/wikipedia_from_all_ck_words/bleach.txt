bleach refers to a number of chemicals which remove color whiten or disinfect often by oxidation
the bleaching process has been known for millennia but the chemicals currently used for bleaching resulted from the work of several 18th century scientists chlorine is the basis for the most commonly used bleaches for example the solution of sodium hypochlorite which is so ubiquitous that most simply call it bleach and calcium hypochlorite the active compound in bleaching powder oxidizing bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate while most bleaches are oxidizing agents some are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite and sodium borohydride
bleaches are used as household chemicals to whiten clothes and remove stains and as disinfectants primarily in the bathroom and kitchen many bleaches have strong bactericidal properties and are used for disinfecting and sterilizing and thus are used in swimming pool sanitation to control bacteria viruses and algae and in any institution where sterile conditions are needed they are also used in many industrial processes notably in the bleaching of wood pulp bleach is also used for removing mildew killing weeds and increasing the longevity of flowers
== historyedit ==
the earliest form of bleaching involved spreading fabrics and cloth out in a bleachfield to be whitened by the action of the sun and water modern bleaches resulted from the work of 18th century scientists including swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele who discovered chlorine french scientists claude berthollet who recognized that chlorine could be used to bleach fabrics and who first made sodium hypochlorite (eau de javel or javel water named after a quarter in paris where it was produced) and antoine germain labarraque who discovered the disinfecting ability of hypochlorites scottish chemist and industrialist charles tennant first produced a solution of calcium hypochlorite then solid calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder)
louis jacques thnard first produced hydrogen peroxide in 1818 by reacting barium peroxide with nitric acid hydrogen peroxide was first used for bleaching in 1882 but did not become commercially important until after 1930 sodium perborate as a laundry bleach had been used in europe since the early twentieth century but did not become popular in north america until the 1980s
== mechanism of actionedit ==
=== whiteningedit ===
colors typically arise from organic dye and pigments such as beta carotene chemical bleaches work in one of two ways
an oxidizing bleach works by breaking the chemical bonds that make up the chromophore this changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore or contains a chromophore that does not absorb visible light this is the mechanism of bleaches based on chlorine
a reducing bleach works by converting double bonds in the chromophore into single bonds this eliminates the ability of the chromophore to absorb visible light this is the mechanism of bleaches based on sulfur dioxide
sunlight acts as a bleach through a process leading to similar results high energy photons of light often in the violet or ultraviolet range can disrupt the bonds in the chromophore rendering the resulting substance colorless extended exposure often leads to massive discoloration usually reducing the colors to white and typically very faded blue spectrums
=== antimicrobial efficacyedit ===
the broad-spectrum effectiveness of bleach particularly sodium hypochlorite is owed to the nature of its chemical reactivity with microbes rather than acting in an inhibitory or toxic fashion in the manner of antibiotics bleach quickly reacts with microbial cells to irreversibly denature and destroy many pathogens bleach particularly sodium hypochlorite has been shown to react with a microbe's heat shock proteins stimulating their role as intra-cellular chaperone and causing the bacteria to form into clumps (much like an egg that has been boiled) that will eventually die off in some cases bleach's base acidity compromises a bacterium's lipid membrane a reaction similar to popping a balloon the range of micro-organisms effectively killed by bleach (particularly sodium hypochlorite) is extensive making it an extremely versatile disinfectant the same study found that at low (micromolar) sodium hypochlorite levels e coli and vibrio cholerae activate a defense mechanism that helps protect the bacteria though the implications of this defense mechanism have not been fully investigated
in response to infection the human immune system will produce a strong oxidizer hypochlorous acid which is generated in activated neutrophils by myeloperoxidase-mediated peroxidation of chloride ions and contributes to the destruction of bacteria
== classes of bleachesedit ==
=== chlorine-based bleachesedit ===
chlorine-based bleaches are found in many household cleaners the concentration of chlorine-based bleaches is often expressed as percent active chlorine where one gram of a 100% active chlorine bleach has the same bleaching power as one gram of chlorine these bleaches can react with other common household chemicals like vinegar or ammonia to produce toxic gases labels on sodium hypochlorite bleach warn about these interactions
==== chemical interactionsedit ====
mixing a hypochlorite bleach with an acid can liberate chlorine gas hypochlorite and chlorine are in equilibrium in water the position of the equilibrium is ph dependent and low ph (acidic) favors chlorine
cl2 + h2o h+ + cl + hclo
chlorine is a respiratory irritant that attacks mucous membranes and burns the skin as little as 3.53 ppm can be detected as an odor and 1000 ppm is likely to be fatal after a few deep breaths exposure to chlorine has been limited to 0.5 ppm (8-hour time-weighted average38 hour week) by osha in the u.s
sodium hypochlorite and ammonia react to form a number of products depending on the temperature concentration and how they are mixed the main reaction is chlorination of ammonia first giving chloramine (nh2cl) then dichloramine (nhcl2) and finally nitrogen trichloride (ncl3) these materials are very irritating to the eyes and lungs and are toxic above certain concentrations nitrogen trichloride is also a very sensitive explosive
nh3 + naocl naoh + nh2cl
nh2cl + naocl naoh + nhcl2
nhcl2 + naocl naoh + ncl3
additional reactions produce hydrazine in a variation of the olin raschig process
nh3 + nh2cl + naoh n2h4 + nacl + h2o
the hydrazine generated can react with more chloramine in an exothermic reaction to produce ammonium chloride and nitrogen gas
2 nh2cl + n2h4 2 nh4cl + n2
however the place of atomic oxygen in accounting for the formation of chlorine is not as plausible as another theory based on the so-called chloride system employed in modern hydrometallurgy to dissolve ores with weak acids in highly ionic and concentrated salt solutions salts particularly effective in this regard include mgcl2 cacl2 fecl3 and to a lesser extent the mono-valent nacl this is in effect an application of the non-common ion theory or as discussed in wikipedia under solubility equilibrium as the salt effect with respect to bleaching powder which has been described as a compound salt of the form ca(clo)2.cacl2.ca(oh)2.xh2o the presence of cacl2 in very concentrated solutions can greatly increase the activity level of weak acids so in this particular proposed application h2co3 from co2 and moisture on the bleaching powder acts on the cacl2 to release some hcl which acts on the hclo releasing chlorine
hclo + hcl h2o + cl2
or the increasing acidity creates more hclo which moves the following known (and old see watt's dictionary of chemistry) equilibrium reaction to the right
cacl2 + 2 hclo = ca(oh)2 + 2 cl2
==== sodium hypochloriteedit ====
sodium hypochlorite is the most commonly encountered bleaching agent usually as a dilute (36%) solution in water this solution of sodium hypochlorite commonly referred to as simply bleach was also one of the first mass-produced bleaches it is produced by passing chlorine gas through a dilute sodium hydroxide solution
cl2 (g) + 2 naoh (aq) nacl (aq) + naclo (aq) + h2o (l)
or by electrolysis of brine (sodium chloride in water)
2 cl cl2 + 2 e
cl2 + h2o hclo + cl + h+
the dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite is used in many households to whiten laundry disinfect hard surfaces in kitchens and bathrooms treat water for drinking and keep swimming pools free of infectious agents
moreover due to transport and handling safety concerns the use of sodium hypochlorite is preferred over chlorine gas in water treatment which represents a significant market expansion potential
==== bleaching powderedit ====
bleaching powder is any of various mixtures of calcium hypochlorite lime (calcium hydroxide) and calcium chloride also known as chlorinated lime it is used in many of the same applications as sodium hypochlorite but is more stable and contains more available chlorine it is usually a white powder a purer more stable form of calcium hypochlorite is called hth or high test hypochlorite bleaching tablets contain calcium hypochlorite and other ingredients to prevent the tablets from crumbling a supposedly more stable mixture of calcium hypochlorite and quicklime (calcium oxide) is known as tropical bleach percent active chlorine in these materials ranges from 20% for bleaching powder to 70% for hth
==== chlorineedit ====
chlorine is produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride
2 nacl + 2 h2o cl2 + h2 + 2 naoh
chlorine is used to prepare sodium and calcium hypochlorites it is used as a disinfectant in water treatment especially to make drinking water and in large public swimming pools chlorine was used extensively to bleach wood pulp but this use has decreased significantly due to environmental concerns
==== chlorine dioxideedit ====
chlorine dioxide clo2 is an unstable gas and is used in situ or stored as dilute aqueous solutions despite these limitations it finds large-scale applications for the bleaching of wood pulp fats and oils cellulose flour textiles beeswax skin and in a number of other industries it can be prepared by oxidizing sodium chlorite with chlorine
2 naclo2 + cl2 2 clo2 + 2 nacl
but more commonly it is prepared by reducing sodium chlorate with a suitable reducing agent like methanol hydrogen peroxide hydrochloric acid or sulfur dioxide
2 naclo3 + 2 hx + r 2 nax + 2 clo2 + ro + h2o
where r is the reducing agent and ro is the oxidized form
=== peroxide-based bleachesedit ===
after chlorine-based bleaches the peroxide bleaches are most commonly encountered peroxides are compounds that contain an oxygen-oxygen single bond o-o this is a fairly weak bond so reactions of peroxides often involve breaking this bond giving very reactive oxygen species most peroxide bleaches are adducts of hydrogen peroxide they contain hydrogen peroxide hooh in combination with another material like sodium carbonate or urea an exception is sodium perborate which has a cyclic structure containing two o-o single bonds all peroxide-based bleaches release hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water peroxide bleaches are often used with catalysts and activators e.g. tetraacetylethylenediamine or sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate
==== hydrogen peroxideedit ====
hydrogen peroxide is produced in very large amounts by several different processes its action as an oxidizer is why it is made and used in such large quantities it is used by itself as a bleaching agent for example to bleach wood pulp hair and so on or to prepare other bleaching agents like the perborates percarbonates peracids etc
==== sodium percarbonateedit ====
sodium percarbonate is produced industrially by reaction of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide followed by crystallization also dry sodium carbonate may be treated directly with concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution
2na2co3 + 3h2o22na2co3.3h2o2
dissolved in water it yields a mixture of hydrogen peroxide (see above) and sodium carbonate it is generally considered to be an eco-friendly cleaning agent
==== sodium perborateedit ====
sodium perborate na2h4b2o8 is made by reacting borax with sodium hydroxide to give sodium metaborate (nabo2) which is then reacted with hydrogen peroxide to give hydrated sodium perborate
na2b4o7 + 2 naoh 4 nabo2 + h2o
2 nabo2 + 2 h2o2 + 6 h2o [nabo2(oh)2 x 3 h2o]2
sodium perborate is useful because it is a stable source of peroxide anions when dissolved in water it forms some hydrogen peroxide but also perborate anion (b(ooh)(oh)3) which is activated for nucleophilic oxidation
=== miscellaneous bleachesedit ===
peracetic acid and ozone are used in the manufacture of paper products especially newsprint and white kraft paper in the food industry some organic peroxides (benzoyl peroxide etc.) and other agents (e.g. bromates) are used as flour bleaching and maturing agents
=== reducing bleachesedit ===
sodium dithionite (also known as sodium hydrosulfite) is one of the most important reductive bleaching agents it is a white crystalline powder with a weak sulfurous odor it can be obtained by reacting sodium bisulfite with zinc
2 nahso3 + zn na2s2o4 + zn(oh)2
it is used as such in some industrial dyeing processes to eliminate excess dye residual oxide and unintended pigments and for bleaching wood pulp
reaction of sodium dithionite with formaldehyde produces rongalite
na2s2o4 + 2 ch2o + h2o nahoch2so3 + nahoch2so2
which is used in bleaching wood pulp cotton wool leather and clay
== environmental impactedit ==
a risk assessment report (rar) conducted by the european union on sodium hypochlorite conducted under regulation eec 793/93 concluded that this substance is safe for the environment in all its current normal uses this is due to its high reactivity and instability disappearance of hypochlorite is practically immediate in the natural aquatic environment reaching in a short time concentration as low as 1022 g/l or less in all emission scenarios in addition it was found that while volatile chlorine species may be relevant in some indoor scenarios they have negligible impact in open environmental conditions further the role of hypochlorite pollution is assumed as negligible in soils
industrial bleaching agents can also be sources of concern for example the use of elemental chlorine in the bleaching of wood pulp produces organochlorines and persistent organic pollutants including dioxins according to an industry group the use of chlorine dioxide in these processes has reduced the dioxin generation to under detectable levels however respiratory risk from chlorine and highly toxic chlorinated byproducts still exists
a recent european study indicated that sodium hypochlorite and organic chemicals (e.g. surfactants fragrances) contained in several household cleaning products can react to generate chlorinated volatile organic compounds (vocs) these chlorinated compounds are emitted during cleaning applications some of which are toxic and probable human carcinogens the study showed that indoor air concentrations significantly increase (852 times for chloroform and 11170 times for carbon tetrachloride respectively above baseline quantities in the household) during the use of bleach containing products the increase in chlorinated volatile organic compound concentrations was the lowest for plain bleach and the highest for the products in the form of thick liquid and gel the significant increases observed in indoor air concentrations of several chlorinated vocs (especially carbon tetrachloride and chloroform) indicate that the bleach use may be a source that could be important in terms of inhalation exposure to these compounds while the authors suggested that using these cleaning products may significantly increase the cancer risk this conclusion appears to be hypothetical
the highest level cited for concentration of carbon tetrachloride (seemingly of highest concern) is 459 micrograms per cubic meter translating to 0.073 ppm (part per million) or 73 ppb (part per billion) the osha-allowable time-weighted average concentration over an eight-hour period is 10 ppm almost 140 times higher
the osha highest allowable peak concentration (5 minute exposure for five minutes in a 4-hour period) is 200 ppm twice as high as the reported highest peak level (from the headspace of a bottle of a sample of bleach plus detergent)
== disinfectionedit ==
sodium hypochlorite solution 36% (common household bleach) is typically diluted for safe use when disinfecting surfaces and when used to treat drinking water when disinfecting most surfaces 1 part liquid household bleach to 100 parts water is sufficient for sanitizing stronger or weaker solutions may be more appropriate to meet specific goals such as destroying resistant viruses or sanitizing surfaces that will not be in contact with food see references for more information
a weak solution of 2% household bleach in warm water is typical for sanitizing smooth surfaces prior to brewing of beer or wine
us government regulations (21 cfr part 178) allow food processing equipment and food contact surfaces to be sanitized with solutions containing bleach provided that the solution is allowed to drain adequately before contact with food and that the solutions do not exceed 200 parts per million (ppm) available chlorine (for example one tablespoon of typical household bleach containing 5.25% sodium hypochlorite per gallon of water)
a 1-in-5 dilution of household bleach with water (1 part bleach to 4 parts water) is effective against many bacteria and some viruses and is often the disinfectant of choice in cleaning surfaces in hospitals (primarily in the united states) the solution is corrosive and needs to be thoroughly removed afterwards so the bleach disinfection is sometimes followed by an ethanol disinfection even scientific-grade commercially produced disinfection solutions such as virocidin-x usually have sodium hypochlorite as their sole active ingredient though they also contain surfactants (to prevent beading) and fragrances (to conceal the bleach smell)
see hypochlorous acid for a discussion of the mechanism for disinfectant action
treatment of gingivitis
diluted sodium hypochlorite at a rate of 20001 (0.05% concentration) may represent an efficacious safe and affordable antimicrobial agent in the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease
== color safe bleachedit ==
color safe bleach is a chemical that uses hydrogen peroxide as the active ingredient (to help remove stains) rather than sodium hypochlorite or chlorine it also has chemicals in it that help brighten colors hydrogen peroxide is also used for sterilization purposes and water treatment but its disinfectant capabilities may be limited due to the concentration in the colorsafe bleach solution as compared to other applications
