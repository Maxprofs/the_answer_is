shells subshellsedit
electron configuration first conceived bohr model atom still common speak shells subshells despite advances understanding quantummechanical nature electrons
electron shell set allowed states share principal quantum number n number letter orbital label electrons may occupy atoms nth electron shell accommodate n electrons eg first shell accommodate electrons second shell electrons third shell electrons factor two arises allowed states doubled due electron spineach atomic orbital admits two otherwise identical electrons opposite spin one spin usually denoted uparrow one spin downarrow
subshell set states defined common azimuthal quantum number within shell values correspond p d f labels respectively maximum number electrons placed subshell given gives two electrons subshell six electrons p subshell ten electrons d subshell fourteen electrons f subshell
numbers electrons occupy shell subshell arise equations quantum mechanics particular pauli exclusion principle states two electrons atom values four quantum numbers
notationedit
physicists chemists use standard notation indicate electron configurations atoms molecules atoms notation consists sequence atomic orbital labels eg phosphorus sequence p p number electrons assigned orbital set orbitals sharing label placed superscript example hydrogen one electron sorbital first shell configuration written lithium two electrons ssubshell one higherenergy ssubshell configuration written pronounced onestwo twosone phosphorus atomic number follows p p
atoms many electrons notation become lengthy abbreviated notation used since last subshells identical one another noble gases phosphorus instance differs neon p presence third shell thus electron configuration neon pulled phosphorus written follows ne p convention useful electrons outermost shell determine chemistry element

superscript singly occupied orbital compulsory quite common see letters orbital labels p d f written italic slanting typeface although international union pure applied chemistry iupac recommends normal typeface used choice letters originates nowobsolete system categorizing spectral lines sharp principal diffuse fundamental fine based observed fine structure modern usage indicates orbitals azimuthal quantum number l respectively f sequence continues alphabetically g h l skipping j although orbitals types rarely required
