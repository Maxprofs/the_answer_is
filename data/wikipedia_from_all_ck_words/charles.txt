charles is a masculine given name from the french form charles of a germanic name karl the original anglo-saxon was earl or eorl as the name of king cearl of mercia that disappeared after the norman conquest of england
the corresponding old norse form is karl the german form is also karl the name was notably borne by charlemagne (charles the great) and was at the time latinized as karolus (as in vita karoli magni) later also as carolus
== etymology ==
the name's etymology is a common germanic noun *karlaz meaning free man which survives in english as churl (< old english eorl) which developed its deprecating sense in the middle english period
in the form charles the initial spelling ch- corresponds to the palatalization of the latin group ca- to [ta] in central old french (francien) and the final -s to the former subjective case (cas sujet) of masculine names in old french like in giles or james (< latin -us see spanish/ portuguese carlos)
according to julius pokorny the historical linguist and indo-europeanist the root meaning of karl is old man from indo-european *er- where the is a palatal consonant meaning to rub to be old grain. an old man has been worn away and is now grey with age
== history ==
=== early middle ages ===
the name is atypical for germanic names as it is not composed of two elements but simply a noun meaning (free) man this meaning of ceorl contrasts with eorl (old norse jarl) nobleman on one hand and with eow (old norse rll) bondsman slave on the other as such it would not seem a likely candidate for the name of a germanic king but it is attested as such with cearl of mercia (fl 620) the first mercian king mentioned by bede in his historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum it is a peculiarity of the anglo-saxon royal names that many of the rulers of the earliest period (6th to 7th centuries) have monothematic (simplex) names while the standard dithematic (compounded) names become almost universal from the 8th century compare the name of king mul of kent (7th century) which simply translates to mule
charles martel (686741) was an illegitimate son of pepin of herstal and therefore indeed a free man but not of noble rank after his victory at the battle of soissons (718) charles martel styled himself duke of the franks charles eldest son was named carloman (c 710754) a rare example of the element carl- occurring in a compound name the chronicle of fredegar names an earlier carloman as the father of pepin of landen and thus the great-great-grandfather of the charles martel this would place the name carloman in the 6th century and open the possibility that the frankish name carl may originate as a short form of carloman the only other compound name with the carl- prefix is carlofred (carlefred) attested in the 7th century as a suffix it occurs in the rare names altcarl and gundecarl (9th and 11th centuries respectively)
charlemagne (742814) was charles martel's grandson after charlemagne's reign the name became irrevocably connected with him and his carolingian dynasty after charlemagne the name charles (karol) became even the standard word for king in slavic (czech and slovak krl polish krl south slavic kral  krlj  russian ) baltic (latvian karalis lithuanian karalius) and hungarian (kirly)
charlemagne's son charles the younger died without issue but the name resurfaces repeatedly within the 9th-century carolingian family tree so with charles the bald (823877) charles the fat (839888) charles of provence (845863) charles the child (847/848866) and charles the simple (879929)
=== later middle ages and early modern history ===
the name survives into the high middle ages (charles duke of lower lorraine charles count of valois charles i count of flanders (charles the good beatified in 1882) charles i of naples charles i of hungary) karl sverkersson was a king of sweden in the 12th century counted as charles vii due to a genealogical fiction of the 17th century by charles ix but actually the first king of sweden with this name
charles resurfaces as a royal name in germany with charles iv holy roman emperor (13161378 counted as the fourth after charlemagne charles the bald and charles the fat) and in france with charles iv of france (12941328 the fourth after charlemagne charles the bald and charles the simple) and becomes comparatively widespread in the late middle ages (charles i duke of savoy charles iii duke of savoy)
charles v holy roman emperor (15001558) gives rise to a tradition of charlses in habsburg spain (charles vi holy roman emperor charles ii of spain charles iii of spain charles iv of spain
the numbering scheme for the kings of sweden was continued in modern times with charles x charles xi charles xii charles xiii charles xiv and charles xv
charles i of england (16001649) is followed by charles ii of england (16301685) the province of carolina is named during the rule of charles ii after charles i
charles iii philip elector palatine (16611742)
=== modern history ===
carlism is a political movement in spain seeking the establishment of a separate line of the bourbon family on the spanish throne this line descended from infante carlos count of molina (17881855) and was founded due to dispute over the succession laws and widespread dissatisfaction with the alfonsine line of the house of bourbon the movement was at its strongest in the 1830s causing the carlist wars and had a revival following spain's defeat in the spanishamerican war in 1898 and lasted until the end of the franco regime in 1975 as a social and political force
