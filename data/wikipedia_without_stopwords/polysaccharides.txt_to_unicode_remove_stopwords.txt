polysaccharides polymeric carbohydrate molecules composed long chains monosaccharide units bound together glycosidic linkages hydrolysis give constituent monosaccharides oligosaccharides range structure linear highly branched examples include storage polysaccharides starch glycogen structural polysaccharides cellulose chitin
polysaccharides often quite heterogeneous containing slight modifications repeating unit depending structure macromolecules distinct properties monosaccharide building blocks may amorphous even insoluble water monosaccharides polysaccharide type polysaccharide called homopolysaccharide homoglycan one type monosaccharide present called heteropolysaccharides heteroglycans
natural saccharides generally simple carbohydrates called monosaccharides general formula chon n three examples monosaccharides glucose fructose glyceraldehyde polysaccharides meanwhile general formula cxhoy x usually large number considering repeating units polymer backbone often sixcarbon monosaccharides general formula also represented chon n
polysaccharides contain ten monosaccharide units definitions large carbohydrate must fall categories polysaccharides oligosaccharides vary according personal opinion polysaccharides important class biological polymers function living organisms usually either structure storagerelated starch polymer glucose used storage polysaccharide plants found form amylose branched amylopectin animals structurally similar glucose polymer densely branched glycogen sometimes called animal starch glycogens properties allow metabolized quickly suits active lives moving animals

even though complex carbohydrates digestible provide important dietary elements humans called dietary fiber carbohydrates enhance digestion among benefits main action dietary fiber change nature contents gastrointestinal tract change nutrients chemicals absorbed soluble fiber binds bile acids small intestine making less likely enter body turn lowers cholesterol levels blood soluble fiber also attenuates absorption sugar reduces sugar response eating normalizes blood lipid levels fermented colon produces shortchain fatty acids byproducts wideranging physiological activities discussion although insoluble fiber associated reduced diabetes risk mechanism occurs unknown
yet formally proposed essential macronutrient dietary fiber nevertheless regarded important diet regulatory authorities many developed countries recommending increases fiber intake
storage polysaccharides
starches
starch glucose polymer glucopyranose units bonded alphalinkages made mixture amylose amylopectin amylose consists linear chain several hundred glucose molecules amylopectin branched molecule made several thousand glucose units every chain glucose units one unit amylopectin starches insoluble water digested break alphalinkages glycosidic bonds humans animals amylases digest starches potato rice wheat maize major sources starch human diet formations starches ways plants store glucose
glycogen
glycogen serves secondary longterm energy storage animal fungal cells primary energy stores held adipose tissue glycogen made primarily liver muscles also made glycogenesis within brain stomach
glycogen analogue starch glucose polymer plants sometimes referred animal starch similar structure amylopectin extensively branched compact starch glycogen polymer glycosidic bonds linked linked branches glycogen found form granules cytosolcytoplasm many cell types plays important role glucose cycle glycogen forms energy reserve quickly mobilized meet sudden need glucose one less compact immediately available energy reserve triglycerides lipids
liver hepatocytes glycogen compose eight percent g adult fresh weight soon meal glycogen stored liver made accessible organs muscles glycogen found low concentration one two percent muscle mass amount glycogen stored bodyespecially within muscles liver red blood cellsvaries physical activity basal metabolic rate eating habits intermittent fasting small amounts glycogen found kidneys even smaller amounts certain glial cells brain white blood cells uterus also stores glycogen pregnancy nourish embryo

arabinoxylans
arabinoxylans found primary secondary cell walls plants copolymers two pentose sugars arabinose xylose
cellulose

chitin
chitin one many naturally occurring polymers forms structural component many animals exoskeletons time biodegradable natural environment breakdown may catalyzed enzymes called chitinases secreted microorganisms bacteria fungi produced plants microorganisms receptors simple sugars decomposition chitin chitin detected produce enzymes digest cleaving glycosidic bonds order convert simple sugars ammonia

pectins family complex polysaccharides contain linked dgalactosyluronic acid residues present primary cell walls nonwoody parts terrestrial plants
acidic polysaccharides
acidic polysaccharides polysaccharides contain carboxyl groups phosphate groups andor sulfuric ester groups
bacterial capsular polysaccharides
pathogenic bacteria commonly produce thick mucouslike layer polysaccharide capsule cloaks antigenic proteins bacterial surface would otherwise provoke immune response thereby lead destruction bacteria capsular polysaccharides watersoluble commonly acidic molecular weights order kda linear consist regularly repeating subunits one six monosaccharides enormous structural diversity nearly two hundred different polysaccharides produced e coli alone mixtures capsular polysaccharides either conjugated native used vaccines
