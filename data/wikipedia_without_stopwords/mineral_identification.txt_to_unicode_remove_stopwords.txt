streak also called powder color mineral color powder produced dragged across unweathered surface unlike apparent color mineral minerals vary considerably trail finely ground powder generally consistent characteristic color thus important diagnostic tool mineral identification streak seems made minerals streak said white colorless streak particularly important diagnostic opaque colored materials less useful silicate minerals white streak hard powder easily
apparent color mineral vary widely trace impurities disturbed macroscopic crystal structure small amounts impurity strongly absorbs particular wavelength radically change wavelengths light reflected specimen thus change apparent color however specimen dragged produce streak broken randomly oriented microscopic crystals small impurities greatly affect absorption light
surface across mineral dragged called streak plate generally made unglazed porcelain tile absence streak plate unglazed underside porcelain bowl vase back glazed tile work sometimes streak easily accurately described comparing streak made another streak plate
