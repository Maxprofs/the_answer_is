a screw or bolt is a type of fastener typically made of metal and characterized by a helical ridge known as a male thread (external thread) or just thread wrapped around a cylinder some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread known as a female thread (internal thread) often in the form of a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted the most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects
a screw will almost always have a head on one end which contains a specially formed shape that allows it to be turned or driven with a tool common tools for driving screws include screwdrivers and wrenches the head is usually larger than the body of the screw which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a bearing surface there are exceptions for instance carriage bolts have a domed head that is not designed to be driven set screws often have a head smaller than the outer diameter of the screw j-bolts have a j-shaped head which is not designed to be driven but rather is usually sunk into concrete allowing it to be used as an anchor bolt the cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the shank it may be fully threaded or partially threaded the distance between each thread is called the pitch
the majority of screws are tightened by clockwise rotation which is termed a right-hand thread a common mnemonic device for remembering this when working with screws or bolts is righty-tighty lefty-loosey. screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases for example when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread) a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice the left side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread
more generally screw may mean any helical device such as a clamp a micrometer a ship's propeller or an archimedes screw water pump
== differentiation between bolt and screwedit ==
there is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt a simple distinction that is often true although not always is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate machinery's handbook describes the distinction as follows
a bolt is an externally threaded fastener designed for insertion through holes in assembled parts and is normally intended to be tightened or released by torquing a nut a screw is an externally threaded fastener capable of being inserted into holes in assembled parts of mating with a preformed internal thread or forming its own thread and of being tightened or released by torquing the head an externally threaded fastener which is prevented from being turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt (example round head bolts track bolts plow bolts.) an externally threaded fastener that has thread form which prohibits assembly with a nut having a straight thread of multiple pitch length is a screw (example wood screws tapping screws.)
this distinction is consistent with asme b18.2.1 and some dictionary definitions for screw and bolt
the issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with machinery's handbook distinction however because of confounding terms the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction and usage variations some of these issues are discussed below
=== machine screwsedit ===
asme standards specify a variety of machine screws in diameters ranging up to 0.75 in (19.05 mm) these fasteners are often used with nuts as well as driven into tapped holes they might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the machinery's handbook distinction in practice they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts
=== hex cap screwsedit ===
asme standard b18.2.1-1996 specifies hex cap screws that range in size from 0.253 in (6.3576.20 mm) in diameter these fasteners are very similar to hex bolts they differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts machinery's handbook refers parenthetically to these fasteners as finished hex bolts reasonably these fasteners might be referred to as bolts but based on the us government document distinguishing bolts from screws the us government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance in 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners congress passed pl 101-592 fastener quality act this resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the asme b18 committee b18.2.1 was re-written and as a result they eliminated the finished hex bolts and renamed them the hex cap screw"a term that had existed in common usage long before but was now also being codified as an official name for the asme b18 standard
=== lug bolts and head boltsedit ===
these terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the machinery's handbook distinction they would be screws here common terms are at variance with machinery's handbook distinction
=== lag screwedit ===
lag screws (also called lag bolts although this is a misnomer) are basically large wood screws square-headed lag screws and hex-headed lag screws are covered by asme b18.2.1 standards and the head is typically an external hex a typical lag bolt can range in diameter from 14 in (6.35 mm) to 1 14 in (31.75 mm) and lengths from 14 to 6 in (6.35 to 152.40 mm) or longer with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger)
the materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc galvanization (for corrosion resistance) the zinc coating may be bright (electroplated) yellow (electroplated) or dull gray hot-dip galvanized lag bolts are used to lag together lumber framing to lag machinery feet to wood floors and for other heavy carpentry applications the adjective lag came from an early principal use of such fasteners the fastening of lags such as barrel staves and other similar parts
these fasteners are screws according to the machinery's handbook criteria and the obsolescent term lag bolt has been replaced by lag screw in the handbook however in the minds of many tradesmen they are bolts simply because they are large with hex or square heads in the united kingdom and australia lag screws are known as coach screws
=== united states government standardsedit ===
the federal government of the united states made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw because different tariffs apply to each the document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners the document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry the legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms coarse and fine to refer to the tightness of the tolerance range referring basically to high-quality or low-quality but this is a poor choice of terms because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to the steepness of the helix's lead)
=== historical issueedit ===
old uss and sae standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded the relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank which is called the grip was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it) this is now an obsolete distinction
=== controlled vocabulary versus natural languageedit ===
the distinctions above are enforced in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations nevertheless there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists auto mechanics and others these differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries the words bolt and screw have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously in response to the technological change (that is the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects themselves change.) non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century the basic meaning of the word screw has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread but the archimedes screw and the screw gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener
the word bolt is also a very old word and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side often via nonthreaded means (clinching forge welding pinning wedging etc.) the connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the crossbow bolt is apparent in the 19th century bolts fastened via screw threads were often called screw bolts in contradistinction to clench bolts
in common usage the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not for example cylinder head bolts are called bolts (at least in north american usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called screws their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity
==== other distinctionsedit ====
bolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting uniform bolt thread specification (such as iso metric screw thread m mj unified thread standard un unr and unj) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut screws are then defined as headed externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts these definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the machinery's handbook distinction and it is for that reason perhaps that some people favor them however they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications
a possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to this definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as tek screws for roof cladding self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter decking screws etc on the other hand a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design
== types of screw and boltedit ==
threaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole
=== fasteners with a tapered shank (self-tapping screws)edit ===
=== fasteners with a non-tapered shankedit ===
=== fasteners with built in washersedit ===
a fastener with a built in washer is called a sem or sems short for pre-assembled it could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank
=== other threaded fastenersedit ===
==== superbolt or multi-jackbolt tensioneredit ====
a superbolt or multi-jackbolt tensioner is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts bolts or studs tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer because of this the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications
==== bone screwsedit ====
the field of screws and other hardware for internal fixation within the body is huge and diverse like prosthetics it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields causing manufacturing technologies (such as machining cad/cam and 3d printing) to intersect with the art and science of medicine like aerospace and nuclear power this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners as well as some of the highest prices for the simple reason that performance longevity and quality have to be excellent in such applications bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium and they often have high-end features such as conical threads multistart threads cannulation (hollow core) and proprietary screw drive types (some not seen outside of these applications)
=== list of abbreviations for types of screwsedit ===
these abbreviations have jargon currency among fastener specialists (who working with many screw types all day long have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions) the smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones for example if you know that fh means flat head then you may be able to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing fh
these abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations each corporation can coin their own the more obscure ones may not be listed here
the extra spacing between linked terms below helps the reader to see the correct parsing at a glance
== materialsedit ==
screws and bolts are usually made of steel where great resistance to weather or corrosion is required like in very small screws or medical implants materials such as stainless steel brass titanium bronze silicon bronze or monel may be used
galvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using aluminum screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material some types of plastic such as nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene (ptfe) can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical insulation
often a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g bright zinc plating for steel screws) to impart a decorative finish (e.g japanning) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material
selection criteria of the screw materials include size required strength resistance to corrosion joint material cost and temperature
== bolted jointsedit ==
the american institute of steel construction (aisc) 13th edition steel design manual section 16.1 chapter j-3 specifies the requirements for bolted structural connections structural bolts replaced rivets due to decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century connections are formed with two types of joints slip-critical connections and bearing connections in slip-critical connections movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension slip is prevented through friction of the faying surface that is the plane of shear for the bolt and where two members make contact because friction is proportional to the normal force connections must be sized with bolts numerous and large enough to provide the required load capacity however this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection the second type and more common connection is a bearing connection in this type of connection the bolts carry the load through shear and are only tightened to a snug-fit these connections require fewer bolts than slip-critical connections and therefore are a less expensive alternative slip-critical connections are more common on flange plates for beam and column splices and moment critical connections bearing type connections are used in light weight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint common bearing type connections include shear tabs beam supports gusset plates in trusses
== mechanical classificationsedit ==
the numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt high-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an iso strength rating (called property class) stamped on the head and the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength the property classes most often used are 5.8 8.8 and 10.9 the number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in mpa divided by 100 the number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength for example a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 mpa and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 mpa
ultimate tensile strength is the stress at which the bolt fails tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain when elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region since the fastener has suffered permanent plastic deformation
mild steel bolts have property class 4.6 high-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8 or above
the same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material for critical high-tensile-strength applications low-grade bolts may fail resulting in damage or injury on sae-standard bolts a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt however low-cost counterfeit fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft automobiles heavy trucks and similar critical applications
=== inchedit ===
sae j429 defines the bolt grades for inch-system sized bolts and screws it defines them by grade which ranges from 0 to 8 with 8 being the strongest higher grades do not exist within the specification sae grades 5 and 8 are the most common
=== metricedit ===
the international standard for metric screws is defined by iso 898 specifically iso 898-1
== screw head shapesedit ==
pan head
a low disc with a rounded outer edge
button or dome head
cylindrical with a rounded top
round head
a dome-shaped head used for decoration
mushroom or truss head
lower-profile dome designed to prevent tampering
countersunk or flat head
conical with flat outer face and tapering inner face allowing it to sink into the material the angle of the screw is measured as the full angle of the cone
oval or raised head
a decorative screw head with a countersunk bottom and rounded top also known as raised countersunk (uk)
bugle head
similar to countersunk but there is a smooth progression from the shank to the angle of the head similar to the bell of a bugle
cheese head
disc with cylindrical outer edge height approximately half the head diameter
fillister head
cylindrical but with a slightly convex top surface height to diameter ratio is larger than cheese head
flanged head
a flanged head can be any of the above head styles (except the countersunk styles) with the addition of an integrated flange at the base of the head this eliminates the need for a flat washer
some varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head which snaps off when adequate torque is applied this prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly an example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle steering columns to secure the ignition switch
== types of screw drivesedit ==
modern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them the most common screw drives are the slotted and phillips in the us hex robertson and torx are also common in some applications and pozidriv has almost completely replaced phillips in europe some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles more exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person
== toolsedit ==
the hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a screwdriver a power tool that does the same job is a power screwdriver power drills may also be used with screw-driving attachments where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical torque-measuring and torque-limiting screwdrivers are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw the hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a spanner (uk usage) or wrench (us usage) while a nut setter is used with a power screw driver
== thread standardsedit ==
there are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws but in much of the world the iso metric screw thread preferred series has displaced the many older systems other relatively common systems include the british standard whitworth ba system (british association) and the unified thread standard
=== iso metric screw threadedit ===
the basic principles of the iso metric screw thread are defined in international standard iso 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in iso 261 the smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws nuts and bolts is given in iso 262 the most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the coarse pitch for some diameters one or two additional fine pitch variants are also specified for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes iso metric screw threads are designated by the letter m followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimeters (e.g m8) if the thread does not use the normal coarse pitch (e.g 1.25 mm in the case of m8) then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g m81 if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8 mm and advances by 1 mm per 360 rotation)
the nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread the tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread thus an m6 screw which has a pitch of 1 mm is made by threading a 6 mm shank and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5 mm diameter (6 mm - 1 mm)
metric hexagon bolts screws and nuts are specified for example in british standard bs 4190 (general purpose screws) and bs 3692 (precision screws) the following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximal width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size)
in addition the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified
=== whitworthedit ===
the first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the english engineer sir joseph whitworth whitworth screw sizes are still used both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required whitworth became british standard whitworth abbreviated to bsw (bs 84:1956) and the british standard fine (bsf) thread was introduced in 1908 because the whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications the thread angle was 55 and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e. the bigger the bolt the coarser the thread) spanners for whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt not the distance across the flats of the screw head
the most common use of a whitworth pitch nowadays is in all uk scaffolding additionally the standard photographic tripod thread which for small cameras is 1/4 whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8 whitworth (16 tpi) it is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips again in both sizes along with thread adapters to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread note that while 1/4 unc bolts fit 1/4 bsw camera tripod bushes yield strength is reduced by the different thread angles of 60 and 55 respectively
=== british association screw threadedit ===
british association (ba) screw threads named after the british association for advancement of science were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903 screws were described as 2ba 4ba etc. the odd numbers being rarely used except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the uk this equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered ba screws in orderit may be suspectedto reduce theft ba threads are specified by british standard bs 93:1951 specification for british association (b.a.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 b.a to 16 b.a.
while not related to iso metric screws the sizes were actually defined in metric terms a 0ba thread having a 6 mm diameter and 1 mm pitch other threads in the ba series are related to 0ba in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2 for example a 4ba thread has pitch mm (0.65mm) and diameter mm (3.62mm) although 0ba has the same diameter and pitch as iso m6 the threads have different forms and are not compatible
ba threads are still common in some niche applications certain types of fine machinery such as moving-coil meters and clocks tend to have ba threads wherever they are manufactured ba sizes were also used extensively in aircraft especially those manufactured in the united kingdom ba sizing is still used in railway signalling mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling
ba threads are extensively used in model engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent as a result many uk model engineering suppliers still carry stocks of ba fasteners up to typically 8ba and 10ba 5ba is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod
=== unified thread standardedit ===
the unified thread standard (uts) is most commonly used in the united states of america but is also extensively used in canada and occasionally in other countries the size of a uts screw is described using the following format x-y where x is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and y is the threads per inch (tpi) for sizes 14 inch and larger the size is given as a fraction for sizes less than this an integer is used ranging from 0 to 16 the integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + 0.013 * number for example a #4 screw is 0.060 + 0.013 * 4 = 0.112 inches in diameter for most size screws there are multiple tpi available with the most common being designated a unified coarse thread (unc or un) and unified fine thread (unf or uf) note in countries other than the united states and canada the iso metric screw thread system is primarily used today unlike most other countries the united states and canada still use the unified (inch) thread system however both are moving over to the iso metric system it is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the united states are still inch based.[67]
== historyedit ==
while a recent hypothesis attributes the archimedes screw to sennacherib king of assyria archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the hellenistic period and the standard view holds the device to be a greek invention most probably by the 3rd century bc polymath archimedes himself though resembling a screw this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word
earlier the screw had been described by the greek mathematician archytas of tarentum (428350 bc) by the 1st century bc wooden screws were commonly used throughout the mediterranean world in screw presses for pressing olive oil from olives and pressing juice from grapes in winemaking metal screws used as fasteners were rare in europe before the 15th century if known at all
rybczynski has shown that handheld screwdrivers (formerly called turnscrews in english in more direct parallel to their original french name tournevis) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest) although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800 once threaded fasteners themselves had become commodified as detailed below
there were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread they tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins wedging mortises and tenons dovetails nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends) forge welding and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber using many kinds of knots prior to the mid-19th century cotter pins or pin bolts and clinch bolts (now called rivets) were used in shipbuilding glues also existed although not in the profusion seen today
the metal screw did not become a common fastener until machine tools for their mass production were developed toward the end of the 18th century this development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged the mass production of wood screws [meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood] in a specialized single-purpose high-volume-production machine tool and the low-count toolroom-style production of machine screws (v-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day)
the first path was pioneered by brothers job and william wyatt of staffordshire uk who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a screw machine of an early and prescient sort it made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later) not until 1776 did the wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running their enterprise failed but new owners soon made it prosper and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employeesthe kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time
meanwhile english instrument maker jesse ramsden (17351800) was working on the toolmaking and instrument-making end of the screw-cutting problem and in 1777 he invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe the british engineer henry maudslay (17711831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800 containing the trifecta of leadscrew slide rest and change-gear gear train all in the right proportions for industrial machining in a sense he unified the paths of the wyatts and ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws i.e. significant easing of production spurring commodification his firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward a misquoting of james nasmyth popularized the notion that maudslay had invented the slide rest but this was incorrect however his lathes helped to popularize it
these developments of the 17601800 era with the wyatts and maudslay being arguably the most important drivers caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners standardization of threadforms began almost immediately but it was not quickly completed it has been an evolving process ever since further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push unit prices lower and lower for decades to come throughout the 19th century
the american development of the turret lathe (1840s) and of automatic screw machines derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control this cost reduction spurred ever greater use of screws
throughout the 19th century the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons these were easy to machine and served most applications adequately rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time in 1908 canadian p l robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (hex socket) shortly followed in 1911
in the early 1930s the popular phillips-head screw was invented by american henry f phillips
threadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s when the iso metric screw thread and the unified thread standard were defined
precision screws for controlling motion rather than fastening developed around the turn of the 19th century were one of the central technical advances along with flat surfaces that enabled the industrial revolution they are key components of micrometers and lathes
