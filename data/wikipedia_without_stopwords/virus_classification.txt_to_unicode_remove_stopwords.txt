virus classification process naming viruses placing taxonomic system similar classification systems used cellular organisms virus classification subject ongoing debate proposals mainly due pseudoliving nature viruses say nonliving particles chemical characteristics similar life fit neatly established biological classification system place cellular organisms
viruses mainly classified phenotypic characteristics morphology nucleic acid type mode replication host organisms type disease cause currently two main schemes used classification viruses international committee taxonomy viruses ictv system baltimore classification system places viruses one seven groups accompanying broad method classification specific naming conventions classification guidelines set ictv
catalog worlds viruses proposed related preliminary efforts accomplished
virus species definition
species form basis biological classification system ictv adopted principle virus species polythetic class viruses constitutes replicating lineage occupies particular ecological niche july ictv definition species changed state species monophyletic group viruses whose properties distinguished species multiple criteria
ictv classification
international committee taxonomy viruses began devise implement rules naming classification viruses early effort continues present ictv body charged international union microbiological societies task developing refining maintaining universal virus taxonomy
system shares many features classification system cellular organisms taxon structure however system nomenclature differs taxonomic codes several points minor point names orders families italicized unlike international code nomenclature algae fungi plants international code zoological nomenclature
viral classification starts level order continues follows taxon suffixes given italics
order virales
family viridae
subfamily virinae
genus virus
species
species names generally take form disease virus
establishment order based inference virus families contains likely evolved common ancestor majority virus families remain unplaced currently seven orders families subfamilies genera species viruses defined ictv orders caudovirales herpesvirales ligamenvirales mononegavirales nidovirales picornavirales tymovirales orders span viruses varying host ranges ligamenvirales infecting archaea recent addition classification system
caudovirales tailed dsdna group bacteriophages
herpesvirales contain large eukaryotic dsdna viruses
ligamenvirales contains linear dsdna group archaean viruses
mononegavirales include nonsegmented strand ssrna group v plant animal viruses
nidovirales composed strand ssrna group iv viruses vertebrate hosts
picornavirales contains small strand ssrna viruses infect variety plant insect animal hosts
tymovirales contain monopartite ssrna viruses infect plants
variations occur orders nidovirales example isolated differentiation expressing structural nonstructural proteins separately
structurebased virus classification
suggested similarity virion assembly structure observed certain viral groups infecting hosts different domains life eg bacterial tectiviruses eukaryotic adenoviruses prokaryotic caudovirales eukaryotic herpesviruses reflects evolutionary relationship viruses therefore structural relationship viruses suggested used basis defining higherlevel taxa structurebased viral lineages could complement existing ictv classification scheme
baltimore classification
baltimore classification first defined classification system places viruses one seven groups depending combination nucleic acid dna rna strandedness singlestranded doublestranded sense method replication named david baltimore nobel prizewinning biologist groups designated roman numerals classifications determined disease caused virus morphology neither satisfactory due different viruses either causing disease looking similar addition viral structures often difficult determine microscope classifying viruses according genome means given category behave similar fashion offering indication proceed research viruses placed one seven following groups
dsdna viruses eg adenoviruses herpesviruses poxviruses
ii ssdna viruses strand sense dna eg parvoviruses
iii dsrna viruses eg reoviruses
iv ssrna viruses strand sense rna eg picornaviruses togaviruses
v ssrna viruses strand antisense rna eg orthomyxoviruses rhabdoviruses
vi ssrnart viruses strand sense rna dna intermediate lifecycle eg retroviruses
vii dsdnart viruses eg hepadnaviruses
dna viruses
group viruses possess doublestranded dna viruses cause chickenpox herpes found
group ii viruses possess singlestranded dna
rna viruses
group iii viruses possess doublestranded rna genomes eg rotavirus
group iv viruses possess positivesense singlestranded rna genomes many well known viruses found group including picornaviruses family viruses includes wellknown viruses like hepatitis virus enteroviruses rhinoviruses poliovirus footandmouth virus sars virus hepatitis c virus yellow fever virus rubella virus
group v viruses possess negativesense singlestranded rna genomes deadly ebola marburg viruses well known members group along influenza virus measles mumps rabies
reverse transcribing viruses
group vi viruses possess singlestranded rna viruses replicate dna intermediate retroviruses included group hiv member
group vii viruses possess doublestranded dna genomes replicate using reverse transcriptase hepatitis b virus found group
holmes classification
holmes used carl linnaeuss system binomial nomenclature classify viruses groups one order virales placed follows
group phaginae attacks bacteria
group ii phytophaginae attacks plants
group iii zoophaginae attacks animals
