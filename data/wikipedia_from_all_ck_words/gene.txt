a gene is a locus (or region) of dna that encodes a functional rna or protein product and is the molecular unit of heredity the transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the geneenvironment interactions some genetic traits are instantly visible such as eye colour or number of limbs and some are not such as blood type risk for specific diseases or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life
genes can acquire mutations in their sequence leading to different variants known as alleles in the population these alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein which cause different phenotype traits colloquial usage of the term having a gene (e.g. good genes, hair colour gene") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene genes evolve due to natural selection or survival of the fittest of the alleles
the concept of a gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered for example regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions and coding regions can be split into several exons some viruses store their genome in rna instead of dna and some gene products are functional non-coding rnas therefore a broad modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression
== history ==
=== discovery of discrete inherited units ===
the existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by gregor mendel (18221884) from 1857 to 1864 he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring he described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas although he did not use the term gene he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics this description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism) mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment the distinction between dominant and recessive traits the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance
prior to mendel's work the dominant theory of heredity was one of blending inheritance which suggested that each parent contributed fluids to the fertilisation process and that the traits of the parents blended and mixed to produce the offspring charles darwin developed a theory of inheritance he termed pangenesis which used the term gemmule to describe hypothetical particles that would mix during reproduction although mendel's work was largely unrecognized after its first publication in 1866 it was rediscovered in 1900 by three european scientists hugo de vries carl correns and erich von tschermak who claimed to have reached similar conclusions in their own research
the word gene is derived (via pangene) from the ancient greek word (gnos) meaning race offspring gene was coined in 1909 by danish botanist wilhelm johannsen to describe the fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity while the related word genetics was first used by william bateson in 1905
=== discovery of dna ===
advances in understanding genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) was shown to be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s the structure of dna was studied by rosalind franklin using x-ray crystallography which led james d watson and francis crick to publish a model of the double-stranded dna molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication collectively this body of research established the central dogma of molecular biology which states that proteins are translated from rna which is transcribed from dna this dogma has since been shown to have exceptions such as reverse transcription in retroviruses the modern study of genetics at the level of dna is known as molecular genetics
in 1972 walter fiers and his team at the university of ghent were the first to determine the sequence of a gene the gene for bacteriophage ms2 coat protein the subsequent development of chain-termination dna sequencing in 1977 by frederick sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing and turned it into a routine laboratory tool an automated version of the sanger method was used in early phases of the human genome project
=== modern evolutionary synthesis ===
the theories developed in the 1930s and 1940s to integrate molecular genetics with darwinian evolution are called the modern evolutionary synthesis a term introduced by julian huxley evolutionary biologists subsequently refined this concept such as george c williams gene-centric view of evolution he proposed an evolutionary concept of the gene as a unit of natural selection with the definition that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency. in this view the molecular gene transcribes as a unit and the evolutionary gene inherits as a unit related ideas emphasizing the centrality of genes in evolution were popularized by richard dawkins
== molecular basis ==
=== dna ===
the vast majority of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of dna (deoxyribonucleic acid) dna consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits each composed of a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose) a phosphate group and one of the four bases adenine cytosine guanine and thymine
two chains of dna twist around each other to form a dna double helix with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine the specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align form two hydrogen bonds whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds the two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand and so on
due to the chemical composition of the pentose residues of the bases dna strands have directionality one end of a dna polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose this is known as the 3 end of the molecule the other end contains an exposed phosphate group this is the 5 end the two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions nucleic acid synthesis including dna replication and transcription occurs in the 5'3 direction because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3 hydroxyl as a nucleophile
the expression of genes encoded in dna begins by transcribing the gene into rna a second type of nucleic acid that is very similar to dna but whose monomers contain the sugar ribose rather than deoxyribose rna also contains the base uracil in place of thymine rna molecules are less stable than dna and are typically single-stranded genes that encode proteins are composed of a series of three-nucleotide sequences called codons which serve as the words in the genetic language the genetic code specifies the correspondence during protein translation between codons and amino acids the genetic code is nearly the same for all known organisms
=== chromosomes ===
the total complement of genes in an organism or cell is known as its genome which may be stored on one or more chromosomes a chromosome consists of a single very long dna helix on which thousands of genes are encoded the region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its locus each locus contains one allele of a gene however members of a population may have different alleles at the locus each with a slightly different gene sequence
the majority of eukaryotic genes are stored on a set of large linear chromosomes the chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome dna packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin the manner in which dna is stored on the histones as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself regulate whether a particular region of dna is accessible for gene expression in addition to genes eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the dna is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division replication origins telomeres and the centromere replication origins are the sequence regions where dna replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during dna replication the length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process the centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division
prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) typically store their genomes on a single large circular chromosome similarly some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular chromosome with a small number of genes prokaryotes sometimes supplement their chromosome with additional small circles of dna called plasmids which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals for example the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can be passed between individual cells even those of different species via horizontal gene transfer
whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively gene-dense those of eukaryotes often contain regions of dna that serve no obvious function simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such dna whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms including humans contain an absolute majority of dna without an identified function this dna has often been referred to as junk dna however more recent analyses suggest that although protein-coding dna makes up barely 2% of the human genome about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed so the term junk dna may be a misnomer
== structure and function ==
the structure of a gene consists of many elements of which the actual protein coding sequence is often only a small part these include dna regions that are not transcribed as well as untranslated regions of the rna
firstly flanking the open reading frame all genes contain a regulatory sequence that is required for their expression in order to be expressed genes require a promoter sequence the promoter is recognized and bound by transcription factors and rna polymerase to initiate transcription a gene can have more than one promoter resulting in messenger rnas (mrna) that differ in how far they extend in the 5 end promoter regions have a consensus sequence however highly transcribed genes have strong promoter sequences that bind the transcription machinery well whereas others have weak promoters that bind poorly and initiate transcription less frequently eukaryotic promoter regions are much more complex and difficult to identify than prokaryotic promoters
additionally genes can have regulatory regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame these act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the dna to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the rna polymerase binding site for example enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the rna polymerase to the promoter conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the dna less available for rna polymerase
the transcribed pre-mrna contains untranslated regions at both ends which contain a ribosome binding site terminator and start and stop codons in addition most eukaryotic open reading frames contain untranslated introns which are removed before the exons are translated the sequences at the ends of the introns dictate the splice sites to generate the final mature mrna which encodes the protein or rna product
many prokaryotic genes are organized into operons with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit the products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network
=== functional definitions ===
defining exactly what section of a dna sequence comprises a gene is difficult regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have to be close to the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening dna can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity similarly a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome
early work in molecular genetics suggested the model that one gene makes one protein this model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mrnas are concatenated by trans-splicing
a broad operational definition is sometimes used to encompass the complexity of these diverse phenomena where a gene is defined as a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products this definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or rna) rather than their specific dna loci with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions
== gene expression ==
in all organisms two steps are required to read the information encoded in a gene's dna and produce the protein it specifies first the gene's dna is transcribed to messenger rna (mrna) second that mrna is translated to protein rna-coding genes must still go through the first step but are not translated into protein the process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either rna or protein is called gene expression and the resulting molecule is called a gene product
=== genetic code ===
the nucleotide sequence of a gene's dna specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein through the genetic code sets of three nucleotides known as codons each correspond to a specific amino acid additionally a start codon and three stop codons indicate the beginning and end of the protein coding region there are 64 possible codons (four possible nucleotides at each of three positions hence 43 possible codons) and only 20 standard amino acids hence the code is redundant and multiple codons can specify the same amino acid the correspondence between codons and amino acids is nearly universal among all known living organisms
=== transcription ===
transcription produces a single-stranded rna molecule known as messenger rna whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the dna from which it was transcribed the mrna acts as an intermediate between the dna gene and its final protein product the gene's dna is used as a template to generate a complementary mrna the mrna matches the sequence of the gene's dna coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand transcription is performed by an enzyme called an rna polymerase which reads the template strand in the 3 to 5 direction and synthesizes the rna from 5 to 3 to initiate transcription the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene thus a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase or by organizing the dna so that the promoter region is not accessible
in prokaryotes transcription occurs in the cytoplasm for very long transcripts translation may begin at the 5 end of the rna while the 3 end is still being transcribed in eukaryotes transcription occurs in the nucleus where the cell's dna is stored the rna molecule produced by the polymerase is known as the primary transcript and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation one of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins this is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes
=== translation ===
translation is the process by which a mature mrna molecule is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein translation is carried out by ribosomes large complexes of rna and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds the genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time in units called codons via interactions with specialized rna molecules called transfer rna (trna) each trna has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mrna the trna is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon when the trna binds to its complementary codon in an mrna strand the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus during and after synthesis most new proteins must folds to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions
=== regulation ===
genes are regulated so that they are expressed only when the product is needed since expression draws on limited resources a cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g available nutrients temperature and other stresses) its internal environment (e.g cell division cycle metabolism infection status) and its specific role if in a multicellular organism gene expression can be regulated at any step from transcriptional initiation to rna processing to post-translational modification of the protein the regulation of lactose metabolism genes in e coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961
=== rna genes ===
a typical protein-coding gene is first copied into rna as an intermediate in the manufacture of the final protein product in other cases the rna molecules are the actual functional products as in the synthesis of ribosomal rna and transfer rna some rnas known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function and microrna has a regulatory role the dna sequences from which such rnas are transcribed are known as non-coding rna genes
some viruses store their entire genomes in the form of rna and contain no dna at all because they use rna to store genes their cellular hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription on the other hand rna retroviruses such as hiv require the reverse transcription of their genome from rna into dna before their proteins can be synthesized rna-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals
== inheritance ==
organisms inherit their genes from their parents asexual organisms simply inherit a complete copy of their parent's genome sexual organisms have two copies of each chromosome because they inherit one complete set from each parent
=== mendelian inheritance ===
according to mendelian inheritance variations in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are due in part to variations in its genotype (particular set of genes) each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait one inherited from each parent
alleles at a locus may be dominant or recessive dominant alleles give rise to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait whereas recessive alleles give rise to their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele for example if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently in the production of gametes or germ cells ensuring variation in the next generation although mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of dna replication and cell division
=== dna replication and cell division ===
the growth development and reproduction of organisms relies on cell division or the process by which a single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells this requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called dna replication the copies are made by specialized enzymes known as dna polymerases which read one strand of the double-helical dna known as the template strand and synthesize a new complementary strand because the dna double helix is held together by base pairing the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy the process of dna replication is semiconservative that is the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of dna
after dna replication is complete the cell must physically separate the two copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells in prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle dna replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as s phase whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during m phase
=== molecular inheritance ===
the duplication and transmission of genetic material from one generation of cells to the next is the basis for molecular inheritance and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents cells in asexually reproducing organisms the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism in sexually reproducing organisms a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid or contain only one copy of each gene the gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova and those produced by males are called sperm two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg a single cell that has two sets of genes with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father
during the process of meiotic cell division an event called genetic recombination or crossing-over can sometimes occur in which a length of dna on one chromatid is swapped with a length of dna on the corresponding sister chromatid this has no effect if the alleles on the chromatids are the same but results in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles if they are different the mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait this is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome the closer two genes lie on the same chromosome the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them this is known as genetic linkage
== molecular evolution ==
=== mutation ===
dna replication is for the most part extremely accurate however errors (mutations) do occur the error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 108 per nucleotide per replication whereas for some rna viruses it can be as high as 103 this means that each generation each human genome accumulates 12 new mutations small mutations can be caused by dna replication and the aftermath of dna damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon) larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication deletion rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome additionally the dna repair mechanisms that normally revert mutations can introduce errors when repairing the physical damage to the molecule is more important than restoring an exact copy for example when repairing double-strand breaks
when multiple different alleles for a gene are present in a species's population it is called polymorphic most different alleles are functionally equivalent however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits a gene's most common allele is called the wild type and rare alleles are called mutants the genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift the wild-type allele is not necessarily the ancestor of less common alleles nor is it necessarily fitter
most mutations within genes are neutral having no effect on the organism's phenotype (silent mutations) some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous mutations) other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g conservative mutations) many mutations however are deleterious or even lethal and are removed from populations by natural selection genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual or can be inherited finally a small fraction of mutations are beneficial improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution
=== sequence homology ===
genes with a most recent common ancestor and thus a shared evolutionary ancestry are known as homologs these genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome where they are known as paralogous genes or are the result of divergence of the genes after a speciation event where they are known as orthologous genes and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms it is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes although the difference is minimal
the relationship between genes can be measured by comparing the sequence alignment of their dna the degree of sequence similarity between homologous genes is called conserved sequence most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular evolution additionally any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate genes under stabilizing selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly the sequence differences between genes can be used for phylogenetic analyses to study how those genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are related
=== origins of new genes ===
the most common source of new genes in eukaryotic lineages is gene duplication which creates copy number variation of an existing gene in the genome the resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent a major source of evolutionary biodiversity sometimes gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes
de novo or orphan genes whose sequence shows no similarity to existing genes are extremely rare estimates of the number of de novo genes in the human genome range from 18 to 60 such genes are typically shorter and simpler in structure than most eukaryotic genes with few if any introns two primary sources of orphan protein-coding genes are gene duplication followed by extremely rapid sequence change such that the original relationship is undetectable by sequence comparisons and formation through mutation of cryptic transcription start sites that introduce a new open reading frame in a region of the genome that did not previously code for a protein
horizontal gene transfer refers to the transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction this mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication it is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance virulence and adaptive metabolic functions although horizontal gene transfer is rare in eukaryotes likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin
== genome ==
the genome is the total genetic material of an organism and includes both the genes and non-coding sequences
=== number of genes ===
the genome size and the number of genes it encodes varies widely between organisms the smallest genomes occur in viruses (which can have as few as 2 protein-coding genes) and viroids (which act as a single non-coding rna gene) conversely plants can have extremely large genomes with rice containing >46,000 protein-coding genes the total number of protein-coding genes (the earth's proteome) is estimated to be 5 million sequences
although the number of base-pairs of dna in the human genome has been known since the 1960s the estimated number of genes has changed over time as definitions of genes and methods of detecting them have been refined initial theoretical predictions of the number of human genes were as high as 2,000,000 early experimental measures indicated there to be 50,000100,000 transcribed genes (expressed sequence tags) subsequently the sequencing in the human genome project indicated that many of these transcripts were alternative variants of the same genes and the total number of protein-coding genes was revised down to ~20,000 with 13 genes encoded on the mitochondrial genome of the human genome only 12% consists of protein-coding genes with the remainder being noncoding dna such as introns retrotransposons and noncoding rnas
=== essential genes ===
essential genes are the set of genes thought to be critical for an organism's survival this definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients and the absence of environmental stress only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential in bacteria an estimated 250400 genes are essential for escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis which is less than 10% of their genes half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes) although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes)
housekeeping genes are critical for carrying out basic cell functions and so are expressed at a relatively constant level (constitutively) since their expression is constant housekeeping genes are used as experimental controls when analysing gene expression not all essential genes are housekeeping genes since some essential genes are developmentally regulated or expressed at certain times during the organism's life cycle
=== genetic and genomic nomenclature ===
gene nomenclature has been established by the hugo gene nomenclature committee (hgnc) for each known human gene in the form of an approved gene name and symbol (short-form abbreviation) which can be accessed through a database maintained by hgnc symbols are chosen to be unique and each gene has only one symbol (although approved symbols sometimes change) symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members of a gene family and with homologs in other species particularly the mouse due to its role as a common model organism
== genetic engineering ==
genetic engineering is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology since the 1970s a variety of techniques have been developed to specifically add remove and edit genes in an organism recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted dna repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired the related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism
genetic engineering is now a routine research tool with model organisms for example genes are easily added to bacteria and lineages of knockout mice with a specific gene's function disrupted are used to investigate that gene's function many organisms have been genetically modified for applications in agriculture industrial biotechnology and medicine
for multicellular organisms typically the embryo is engineered which grows into the adult genetically modified organism however the genomes of cells in an adult organism can be edited using gene therapy techniques to treat genetic diseases
