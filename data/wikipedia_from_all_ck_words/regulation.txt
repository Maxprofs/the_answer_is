a regulation is a legal norm intended to shape conduct that is a by-product of imperfection a regulation may be used to prescribe or proscribe conduct ("command-and-control regulation) to calibrate incentives ("incentive regulation) or to change preferences ("preferences shaping regulation") in statist mechanisms it can also be extended to monitoring and enforcement of rules as established by primary and/or delegated legislation in this form it is generally a written instrument containing rules having the force of statist law (as opposed to natural law) other forms of regulation are self regulation in general regulations are written by executive agencies as a way to enforce laws passed by the legislature because of the actual or potential interference in choices the idea of regulation and most issues related to regulation tend to be in controversy
regulation creates limits constrains a right creates or limits a duty or allocates a responsibility regulation can take many forms legal restrictions promulgated by a government authority contractual obligations that bind many parties (for example insurance regulations that arise out of contracts between insurers or reinsurers and their insureds) self-regulation by an industry such as through a trade association social regulation (e.g norms) co-regulation third-party regulation certification accreditation or market regulation in its legal sense regulation can and should be distinguished from primary legislation (by parliament of elected legislative body) on the one hand and judge-made law on the other
regulation mandated by a state attempts to produce outcomes which might not otherwise occur produce or prevent outcomes in different places to what might otherwise occur or produce or prevent outcomes in different timescales than would otherwise occur in this way regulations can be seen as implementation artifacts of policy statements common examples of regulation include controls on market entries prices wages development approvals pollution effects employment for certain people in certain industries standards of production for certain goods the military forces and services the economics of imposing or removing regulations relating to markets is analysed in regulatory economics
== reasons ==
regulations may create costs as well as benefits and may produce unintended reactivity effects such as defensive practice efficient regulations can be defined as those where total benefits exceed total costs
regulations can be advocated for a variety of reasons including
market failures - regulation due to inefficiency intervention due to what economists call market failure
to constrain sellers options in markets characterized by monopoly
as a means to implement collective action in order to provide public goods
to assure adequate information in the market
to mitigate undesirable externalities
collective desires - regulation about collective desires or considered judgments on the part of a significant segment of society
diverse experiences - regulation with a view of eliminating or enhancing opportunities for the formation of diverse preferences and beliefs
social subordination - regulation aimed to increase or reduce social subordination of various social groups
endogenous preferences - regulation intended to affect the development of certain preferences on an aggregate level
irreversibility - regulation that deals with the problem of irreversibility the problem in which a certain type of conduct from current generations results in outcomes from which future generations may not recover from at all
professional conduct - the regulation of members of professional bodies either acting under statutory or contractual powers
interest group transfers - regulation that results from efforts by self-interest groups to redistribute wealth in their favor which may be disguised as one or more of the justifications above
the study of formal (legal and/or official) and informal (extra-legal and/or unofficial) regulation constitutes one of the central concerns of the sociology of law
== history ==
regulation of businesses existed in the ancient early egyptian indian greek and roman civilizations standardized weights and measures existed to an extent in the ancient world and gold may have operated to some degree as an international currency in china a national currency system existed and paper currency was invented sophisticated law existed in ancient rome in the european early middle ages law and standardization declined with the roman empire but regulation existed in the form of norms customs and privileges this regulation was aided by the unified christian identity and a sense of honor in regard to contracts
beginning in the late 19th and 20th century much of regulation in the united states was administered and enforced by regulatory agencies which produced their own administrative law and procedures under the authority of statutes legislators created these agencies to allow experts in the industry to focus their attention on the issue at the federal level one of the earliest institutions was the interstate commerce commission which had its roots in earlier state-based regulatory commissions and agencies later agencies include the federal trade commission securities and exchange commission civil aeronautics board and various other institutions these institutions vary from industry to industry and at the federal and state level individual agencies do not necessarily have clear life-cycles or patterns of behavior and they are influenced heavily by their leadership and staff as well as the organic law creating the agency in the 1930s lawmakers believed that unregulated business often led to injustice and inefficiency in the 1960s and 1970s concern shifted to regulatory capture which led to extremely detailed laws creating the united states environmental protection agency and occupational safety and health administration
