population density (in agriculture standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume it is a quantity of type number density it is frequently applied to living organisms and particularly to humans it is a key geographic term
lists of population density of different countries are below lists of other population densities are in see also section
== biological population densitiesedit ==
population density is population divided by total land area or water volume as appropriate
low densities may cause an extinction vortex and lead to further reduced fertility this is called the allee effect after the scientist who identified it examples of the causes in low population densities include
increased problems with locating sexual mates
increased inbreeding
=== human population densityedit ===
for humans population density is the number of people per unit of area usually quoted per square kilometer or square mile (which may include or exclude for example areas of water or glaciers) commonly this may be calculated for a county city country another territory or the entire world
the world's population is around 7 billion and earth's total area (including land and water) is 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles) therefore the worldwide human population density is around 7 billion 510 million = 13.7 per km2 (35 per sq mile) if only the earth's land area of 150 million km2 (58 million sq miles) is taken into account then human population density increases to 47 per km2 (120 per sq mile) this includes all continental and island land area including antarctica if antarctica is also excluded then population density rises to over 50 people per km2 (over 130 per sq mile) however over half of the earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human habitation such as deserts and high mountains and population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources thus this number by itself does not give any helpful measurement of human population density
several of the most densely populated territories in the world are city-states microstates and dependencies these territories have a relatively small area and a high urbanization level with an economically specialized city population drawing also on rural resources outside the area illustrating the difference between high population density and overpopulation
cities with high population densities are by some considered to be overpopulated though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources most of the most densely populated cities are in southeast asia though cairo and lagos in africa also fall into this category
city population and especially area are however heavily dependent on the definition of urban area used densities are almost invariably higher for the central city area than when suburban settlements and the intervening rural areas are included as in the areas of agglomeration or metropolitan area the latter sometimes including neighboring cities for instance milwaukee has a greater population density when just the inner city is measured and the surrounding suburbs excluded
in comparison based on a world population of seven billion the world's inhabitants as a loose crowd taking up ten square feet (one square metre) per person (jacobs method) would occupy a space a little larger than delaware's land area

==== other methods of measurementedit ====
although arithmetic density is the most common way of measuring population density several other methods have been developed to provide a more accurate measure of population density over a specific area
arithmetic density the total number of people / area of land (measured in square miles or square kilometers )
physiological density the total population / area of arable land
agricultural density the total rural population / area of arable land
residential density the number of people living in an urban area / area of residential land
urban density the number of people inhabiting an urban area / total area of urban land
ecological optimum the density of population that can be supported by the natural resources
