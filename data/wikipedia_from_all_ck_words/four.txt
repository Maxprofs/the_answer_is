== origins ==
representing 1 2 and 3 in as many lines as the number represented worked well the brahmin indians simplified 4 by joining its four lines into a cross that looks like our modern plus sign the shunga would add a horizontal line on top of the numeral and the kshatrapa and pallava evolved the numeral to a point where speed of writing was a secondary concern the arabs 4 still had the early concept of the cross but for the sake of efficiency was made in one stroke by connecting the western end to the northern end the eastern end was finished off with a curve the europeans dropped the finishing curve and gradually made the numeral less cursive ending up with a glyph very close to the original brahmin cross
while the shape of the 4 character has an ascender in most modern typefaces in typefaces with text figures the character usually has a descender as for example in 
on the seven-segment displays of pocket calculators and digital watches as well as certain optical character recognition fonts 4 is seen with an open top
