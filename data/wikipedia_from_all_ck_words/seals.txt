the united states navy's sea air and land teams commonly known as the navy seals are the u.s navy's principal special operations force and a part of the naval special warfare command and united states special operations command one of the seals primary functions is to conduct small-unit maritime military operations which originate from and return to a river ocean swamp delta or coastline seals can negotiate shallow water areas such as the persian gulf coastline where large ships and submarines are limited due to depth the navy seals are trained to operate in all environments (sea air and land) for which they are named seals are also prepared to operate in a variety of climates such as desert arctic and jungle
all seals are male members of the united states navy the cia's highly secretive special activities division (sad) and more specifically its elite special operations group (sog) recruits operators from the seal teams joint navy seals and cia operations go back to the macv-sog during the vietnam war this cooperation still exists today and is seen in the wars in iraq and afghanistan
== historyedit ==
=== originsedit ===
the modern day u.s navy seals can trace their roots to world war ii the united states navy recognized the need for the covert reconnaissance of landing beaches and coastal defenses as a result the amphibious scout and raider school was established in 1942 at fort pierce florida the scouts and raiders were formed in september of that year just nine months after the attack on pearl harbor from the observer group a joint u.s army-marine-navy unit
=== scouts and raidersedit ===
recognizing the need for a beach reconnaissance force a select group of army and navy personnel assembled at amphibious training base little creek virginia on august 15 1942 to begin amphibious scouts and raiders (joint) training the scouts and raiders mission was to identify and reconnoiter the objective beach maintain a position on the designated beach prior to a landing and guide the assault waves to the landing beach
the first group included phil h bucklew the father of naval special warfare, after whom the naval special warfare center building is named commissioned in october 1942 this group saw combat in november 1942 during operation torch on the north african coast scouts and raiders also supported landings in sicily salerno anzio normandy and southern france
a second group of scouts and raiders code-named special service unit no 1 was established on 7 july 1943 as a joint and combined operations force the first mission in september 1943 was at finschafen on new guinea later operations were at gasmata arawe cape gloucester and the east and south coast of new britain all without any loss of personnel conflicts arose over operational matters and all non-navy personnel were reassigned the unit renamed 7th amphibious scouts received a new mission to go ashore with the assault boats buoy channels erect markers for the incoming craft handle casualties take offshore soundings clear beach obstacles and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore incoming boats and nearby ships the 7th amphibious scouts conducted operations in the pacific for the duration of the conflict participating in more than 40 landings
the third and final scouts and raiders organization operated in china scouts and raiders were deployed to fight with the sino-american cooperative organization or saco to help bolster the work of saco admiral ernest j king ordered that 120 officers and 900 men be trained for amphibious raider at the scout and raider school at fort pierce florida they formed the core of what was envisioned as a guerrilla amphibious organization of americans and chinese operating from coastal waters lakes and rivers employing small steamboats and sampans. while most amphibious raider forces remained at camp knox in calcutta three of the groups saw active service they conducted a survey of the upper yangtze river in the spring of 1945 and disguised as coolies conducted a detailed three-month survey of the chinese coast from shanghai to kitchioh wan near hong kong
=== naval combat demolition unitsedit ===
in september 1942 17 navy salvage personnel arrived at atb little creek va for a week long course in demolitions explosive cable cutting and commando raiding techniques on november 10 1942 the first combat demolition unit successfully cut cable and net barriers across the wadi sebou river during operation torch in north africa this enabled the uss dallas (dd-199) to traverse the water and insert u.s rangers who captured the port lyautey airdrome
on 7 may 1943 lieutenant commander draper l kauffman the father of naval combat demolition, was directed to set up a school and train people to eliminate obstacles on an enemy-held beach prior to an invasion on 6 june 1943 lcdr kauffman established naval combat demolition unit training at fort pierce most of kauffman's volunteers came from the navy's engineering and construction battalions training commenced with a gruelling week designed to filter out under-performing candidates by april 1944 a total of 34 ncdus were deployed to england in preparation for operation overlord the amphibious landing at normandy on 6 june 1944 in the face of great adversity the ncdus at omaha beach managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the german defenses the ncdus suffered 31 killed and 60 wounded a casualty rate of 52% meanwhile the ncdus at utah beach met less intense enemy fire they cleared 700 yards (640 metres) of beach in two hours another 900 yards (820 metres) by the afternoon
casualties at utah beach were significantly lighter with six killed and eleven wounded during operation overlord not a single demolitioneer was lost to improper handling of explosives in august 1944 ncdus from utah beach participated in the landings in southern france the last amphibious operation in the european theater of operations ncdus also operated in the pacific theater ncdu 2 under ltjg frank kaine after whom the naval special warfare command building is named and ncdu 3 under ltjg lloyd anderson formed the nucleus of six ncdus that served with the seventh amphibious force tasked with clearing boat channels after the landings from biak to borneo
=== oss operational swimmersedit ===
some of the earliest world war ii predecessors of the seals were the operational swimmers of the office of strategic services or oss many current seal missions were first assigned to them oss specialized in special operations dropping operatives behind enemy lines to engage in organized guerrilla warfare as well as to gather information on such things as enemy resources and troop movements british combined operations veteran lcdr wooley of the royal navy was placed in charge of the oss maritime unit in june 1943 their training started in november 1943 at camp pendleton california moved to santa catalina island california in january 1944 and finally moved to the warmer waters of the bahamas in march 1944 within the u.s military they pioneered flexible swimfins and diving masks closed-circuit diving equipment (under the direction of dr christian j lambertsen) the use of swimmer delivery vehicles (a type of submersible) and combat swimming and limpet mine attacks in may 1944 colonel wild bill donovan the head of the oss divided the unit into groups he loaned group 1 under lieutenant choate to admiral nimitz as a way to introduce the oss into the pacific theater they became part of udt-10 in july 1944 five oss men participated in the very first udt submarine operation with the uss burrfish in the caroline islands in august 1944
=== underwater demolition teams (udt)edit ===
on 23 november 1943 the u.s marine landing on tarawa atoll emphasized the need for hydrographic reconnaissance and underwater demolition of obstacles prior to any amphibious landing the islands in this area have unpredictable tide changes and shallow reefs preventing the naval transport vessels from progressing the first wave crossed the reef in amtracs but the second in higgins boats were not as successful they got stuck on a reef due to low tide the marines were forced to unload and wade to shore this proved to be a daunting task and many marines were killed or drowned before reaching the beach without support from the second wave the marines in amtracs were slaughtered on the beach this was a valuable lesson that the navy did not want to be repeated after the tarawa landing rear admiral richmond k turner directed the formation of nine underwater demolition teams thirty officers and 150 enlisted men were moved to the waimnalo amphibious training base to form the nucleus of a demolition training program this group became underwater demolition teams (udt) one and two
the udts saw their first combat on 31 january 1944 during operation flintlock in the marshall islands flintlock became the real catalyst for the udt training program in the pacific theater in february 1944 the naval combat demolition training and experimental base was established at khei maui next to the amphibious base at kamaole eventually 34 udt teams were established wearing swim suits fins and dive masks on combat operations these naked warriors saw action across the pacific in every major amphibious landing including eniwetok saipan guam tinian angaur ulithi peleliu leyte lingayen gulf zambales iwo jima okinawa labuan brunei bay and on 4 july 1945 at balikpapan on borneo which was the last udt demolition operation of the war the rapid demobilization at the conclusion of the war reduced the number of active duty udts to two on each coast with a complement of seven officers and 45 enlisted men each
=== korean waredit ===
the korean war began on 25 june 1950 when the north korean army invaded south korea beginning with a detachment of 11 personnel from udt 3 udt participation expanded to three teams with a combined strength of 300 men during the forgotten war the udts fought heroically beginning to employ demolition expertise gained from wwii and use it for an offensive role continuing to use water as cover and concealment as well as an insertion method the korean era udts targeted bridges tunnels fishing nets and other maritime and coastal targets they also developed a close working relationship with the republic of korea naval special forces which continues today
the udts refined and developed their commando tactics during the korean war through their focused efforts on demolitions and mine disposal the udts also accompanied south korean commandos on raids in the north to demolish train tunnels this was frowned upon by higher-ranking officials because they believed it was a non-traditional use of naval forces due to the nature of the war the udts maintained a low operational profile some of the missions include transporting spies into north korea and the destruction of north korean fishing nets used to supply the north korean army
as part of the special operations group or sog udts successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the korean coast the udts specialized in a somewhat new mission night coastal demolition raids against railroad tunnels and bridges the udt men were given the task because in the words of udt lieutenant ted fielding we were ready to do what nobody else could do and what nobody else wanted to do. (ted fielding was awarded the silver star during korea and was later promoted to the rank of captain) on 15 september 1950 udts supported operation chromite the amphibious landing at incheon udt 1 and 3 provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft scouting mud flats marking low points in the channel clearing fouled propellers and searching for mines four udt personnel acted as wave-guides for the marine landing in october 1950 udts supported mine-clearing operations in wonsan harbor where frogmen would locate and mark mines for minesweepers on 12 october 1950 two u.s minesweepers hit mines and sank udts rescued 25 sailors the next day william giannotti conducted the first u.s combat operation using an aqualung when he dove on the uss pledge (am-277) for the remainder of the war udts conducted beach and river reconnaissance infiltrated guerrillas behind the lines from sea continued mine sweeping operations and participated in operation fishnet which devastated the north korean's fishing capability
=== birth of navy seals and vietnamedit ===
president john f kennedy aware of the situation in southeast asia recognized the need for unconventional warfare and special operations as a measure against guerrilla warfare in a speech to congress on 25 may 1961 kennedy spoke of his deep respect for the united states army special forces while his announcement of the government's plan to put a man on the moon drew most of the attention in the same speech he announced his intention to spend over $100 million to strengthen u.s special operations forces and expand american capabilities in unconventional warfare some people erroneously credit president kennedy with creating the navy seals his announcement was actually only a formal acknowledgement of a process that had been under way since korea
the navy needed to determine its role within the special operations arena in march 1961 admiral arleigh burke the chief of naval operations recommended the establishment of guerrilla and counter-guerrilla units these units would be able to operate from sea air or land this was the beginning of the navy seals all seals came from the navy's underwater demolition teams who had already gained extensive experience in commando warfare in korea however the underwater demolition teams were still necessary to the navy's amphibious force
the first two teams were formed in january 1962 and stationed on both us coasts team one at naval amphibious base coronado in san diego california and team two at naval amphibious base little creek in virginia beach virginia formed entirely with personnel from udts the seals mission was to conduct counter guerilla warfare and clandestine operations in maritime and riverine environments men of the newly formed seal teams were trained in such unconventional areas as hand-to-hand combat high-altitude parachuting demolitions and foreign languages the seals attended underwater demolition team replacement training and they spent some time training in udts upon making it to a seal team they would undergo a seal basic indoctrination (sbi) training class at camp kerry in the cuyamaca mountains after sbi training class they would enter a platoon and conduct platoon training
according to founding seal team member roy boehm the seals first missions were directed against communist cuba these consisted of deploying from submarines and carrying out beach reconnaissance in prelude to a proposed us amphibious invasion of the island on at least one occasion boehm and another seal smuggled a cia agent ashore to take pictures of soviet nuclear missiles being unloaded on the dockside
the pacific command recognized vietnam as a potential hot spot for unconventional forces at the beginning of 1962 the udts started hydrographic surveys and along with other branches of the us military the military assistance command vietnam (macv) was formed in march 1962 seals were deployed to south vietnam as advisors for the purpose of training army of the republic of vietnam commandos in the same methods they were trained themselves
the central intelligence agency began using seals in covert operations in early 1963 the seals were involved in the cia sponsored phoenix program where it targeted key north vietnamese army personnel and vietcong sympathizers for capture and assassination
the seals were initially deployed in and around da nang training the south vietnamese in combat diving demolitions and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics as the war continued the seals found themselves positioned in the rung sat special zone where they were to disrupt the enemy supply and troop movements and in the mekong delta to fulfill riverine operations fighting on the inland waterways
combat with the viet cong was direct unlike the conventional warfare methods of firing artillery into a coordinate location the seals operated close to their targets into the late 1960s the seals were successful in a new style of warfare effective in anti-guerrilla and guerrilla actions seals brought a personal war to the enemy in a previously safe area the viet cong referred to them as the men with green faces, due to the camouflage face paint the seals wore during combat missions
in february 1966 a small seal team one detachment arrived in vietnam to conduct direct actions missions operating from nha be in the rung sat special zone this detachment signaled the beginning of a seal presence that would eventually include 8 seal platoons in country on a continuing basis seals also served as advisors for provincial reconnaissance units and the lein doc nguio nhia the vietnamese seals the last seal platoon departed vietnam on dec 7 1971 the last seal advisor left in march 1973
seals continued to make forays into north vietnam and laos and covertly into cambodia controlled by the studies and observations group the seals from team two started a unique deployment of seal team members working alone with south vietnamese commandos (arvn) in 1967 a seal unit named detachment bravo (det bravo) was formed to operate these mixed us and arvn units which were called south vietnamese provincial reconnaissance units (prus)
at the beginning of 1968 the north vietnamese and the viet cong orchestrated a major offensive against south vietnam the tet offensive the north hoped it would prove to be america's dien bien phu attempting to break the american public's desire to continue the war as propaganda the tet offensive was successful in adding to the american protest of the vietnam war however north vietnam suffered tremendous casualties and from a purely military standpoint the tet offensive was a major disaster for the communists
by 1970 president richard nixon initiated a plan of vietnamization which would remove the us from the vietnam war and return the responsibility of defense back to the south vietnamese conventional forces were being withdrawn the last seal advisor left vietnam in march 1973 and vietnam fell to the communists in 1975 the seals were among the highest decorated units for their size in the war receiving 2 navy crosses 42 silver stars 402 bronze stars 2 legions of merit 352 commendation medals 3 presidential unit citations and 3 medals of honor by the end of the war 48 seals had been killed in vietnam but estimates of their kill count are as high as 2,000 the navy seal museum in fort pierce fl displays a list of the 48 seals who lost their lives in combat during the vietnam war
=== grenadaedit ===
both seal team 4 and seal team 6 the predecessor to devgru participated in the us invasion of grenada the seals two primary missions were the extraction of grenada's governor-general and the capture of grenada's only radio tower neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the seals ran into trouble from the very beginning one of their two transport planes missed its drop zone and four seals drowned in a rain squall while making an airborne insertion with their boats off the island's coast their bodies were never recovered
after regrouping from their initial insertion the seals split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives after digging in at the governor's mansion the seals realized they had forgotten to load their cryptographic satellite phone as grenadian and cuban troops surrounded the team the seals only radio ran out of battery power and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in ac-130 gunship fire support the seals were pinned down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted by a group of marines the following morning
the team sent to the radio station also ran into communication problems as soon as the seals reached the radio facility they found themselves unable to raise their command post after beating back several waves of grenadian and cuban troops supported by btr-60 armoured personnel carriers the seals decided that their position at the radio tower was untenable they destroyed the station and fought their way to the water where they hid from patrolling enemy forces after the enemy had given up their search the seals some wounded swam into the open sea where they were extracted several hours later after being spotted by a reconnaissance plane
=== iran-iraq waredit ===
during the closing stages of the iraniraq war the united states navy began conducting operations in the persian gulf to protect us-flagged ships from attack by iranian naval forces a secret plan was put in place and dubbed operation prime chance navy seal teams 1 and 2 along with several special boat units and eod techs were deployed on mobile command barges and transported by helicopters from the army's 160th special operations aviation regiment over the course of the operation seals conducted vbss (visit board search and seizure) missions to counter iranian mine laying boats the only loss of life occurred during the take down of the iran ajr evidence gathered on the iran ajr by the seals later allowed the us navy to trace the mines that struck the uss samuel b roberts (ffg-58) this chain of events lead to operation praying mantis the largest us naval surface engagement since the second world war
during operation desert shield and storm navy seals trained kuwaiti special forces they set up naval special operations groups in kuwait working with the kuwaiti navy in exile using these new diving swimming and combat skills these commandos took part in combat operations such as the liberation of the capital city
=== panamaedit ===
the united states navy contributed extensive special operations assets to the invasion of panama code named operation just cause this included seal teams 2 and 4 naval special warfare unit 8 and special boat unit 26 all falling under naval special warfare group 2 and the separate naval special warfare development group (devgru) devgru fell under task force blue while naval special warfare group 2 composed the entirety of task force white task force white was tasked with three principal objectives the destruction of panamanian defense forces (pdf) naval assets in balboa harbor and the destruction of manuel noriega's private jet at paitilla airport (collectively known as operation nifty package) as well as isolating pdf forces on flamenco island
the strike on balboa harbor by task unit whiskey is notably marked in seal history as the first publicly acknowledged combat swimmer mission since the second world war prior to the commencement of the invasion four navy seals lt edward s coughlin en-3 timothy k eppley et-1 randy l beausoleil and ph-2 chris dye swam underwater into the harbor on draeger lar-v rebreathers and attached c4 explosives to and destroyed noriega's personal gunboat the presidente porras
task unit papa was tasked with the seizure of paitilla airfield and the destruction of noriega's plane there several seals were concerned about the nature of the mission assigned to them being that airfield seizure was usually the domain of the army rangers despite these misgivings and a loss of operational surprise the seals of tu papa proceeded with their mission almost immediately upon landing the 48 seals came under withering fire from the pdf stationed at the airfield although noriega's plane was eventually destroyed the seals suffered four dead and thirteen wounded killed were lt john connors chief petty officer donald mcfaul torpedoman's mate 2nd class issac rodriguez and boatswain's mate 1st class chris tilghman
=== gulf waredit ===
in august 1990 seals were the first western forces to deploy to the persian gulf as part of operation desert shield they infiltrated the capital city of kuwait within hours of the invasion and gathered intelligence and developed plans to rescue us embassy staff should they become hostages seals were also the first to capture iraqi prisoners of war when they assaulted nine kuwaiti oil platforms on 19 january 1991 on 23 february 1991 a six-man seal team led by lieutenant tom dietz launched a mission to trick the iraqi military into thinking an amphibious assault on kuwait by coalition forces was imminent by setting off explosives and placing marking buoys 500 meters off the kuwaiti coast the mission was a success and iraqi forces were diverted east away from the true coalition offensive
=== somali interventionedit ===
in august 1993 a four-man devgru seal sniper team was deployed to mogadishu to work alongside delta force as part of task force ranger in the search for somali warlord mohammed farrah aidid they took part in several operations in support of the cia and army culminating in the 3 october battle of mogadishu where they were part of the ground convoy raiding the olympic hotel all four seals would be later awarded the silver star in recognition of their bravery whilst navy seal howard e wasdin would be awarded a purple heart after continuing to fight despite being wounded three times during the battle
=== afghanistanedit ===
==== invasionedit ====
in the immediate aftermath of the 11 september attacks navy seals quickly dispatched to camp doha and those already aboard us naval vessels in the persian gulf and surrounding waters began conducting vbss operations against ships suspected of having ties to or even carrying al qaeda operatives seal teams 3 and 8 also began rotating into oman from the united states and staging on the island of masirah for operations in afghanistan one of the seals immediate concerns was their lack of suitable vehicles to conduct special reconnaissance (sr) missions in the rough landlocked terrain of afghanistan after borrowing and retrofitting humvees from the army rangers also staging on masirah the seals inserted into afghanistan to conduct the sr of what would become camp rhino as part of operation enduring freedom (oef) these early stages of oef were commanded by a fellow seal rear admiral albert calland
the sr mission in the region of camp rhino lasted for four days after which two united states air force combat control teams made a nighttime halo jump to assist the seals in guiding in marines from the 15th marine expeditionary unit who seized control of the area and established a forward operating base while at camp rhino the cia passed on intelligence from a predator drone operating in the paktia province that taliban mullah khirullah said wali khairkhwa was spotted leaving a building by vehicle convoy seals and danish jgerkorpset commandos boarded air force pave low helicopters and seized khairkhwa on the road less than two hours later the seals continued to perform reconnaissance operations for the marines until leaving after having spent 45 days on the ground
subsequent seal operations during the invasion of afghanistan were conducted within task force k-bar a joint special operations unit of army special forces united states air force special tactics teams and special operations forces from norway germany australia new zealand canada and denmark under the command of navy seal captain robert harward task force k-bar conducted combat operations in the massive cave complexes at zhawar kili the city of kandahar and surrounding territory the town of prata ghar and hundreds of miles of rough terrain in southern and eastern afghanistan over the course of six months task force k-bar killed or captured over 200 taliban and al qaeda fighters and destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of weapons and ordnance
navy seals participated extensively in operation anaconda during insertion ab1 neil roberts was thrown from his helicopter when it took fire from entrenched al qaeda fighters roberts was subsequently killed after engaging and fighting dozens of enemies for almost an hour several seals were wounded in a rescue attempt and their air force combat controller technical sergeant john chapman was killed attempts to rescue the stranded seal also led to the deaths of several us army rangers and an air force pararescueman acting as a quick reaction force
seals were present at the battle of qala-i-jangi alongside their counterparts from the british special boat service chief petty officer stephen bass was awarded the navy cross for his actions during the battle
lieutenant michael p murphy was posthumously awarded the medal of honor after his four-man counterinsurgency team was almost wiped out during operation red wings in june 2005 after the four man team lost danny p dietz he put himself in open view to call in the qrf he soon after died from injuries sustained matthew g axelson also died on this operation the qrf never reached the scene it was struck by an rpg killing 8 navy seals and 8 army night stalkers marcus luttrell was the only survivor from this operation
in december 2012 the unit rescued a us doctor who had been kidnapped a few days earlier however during the operation the unit suffered a fatality petty officer 1st class nicolas d checque
in may 2013 rear adm sean pybus commander of navy special warfare stated that the unit would cut in half the number of seal platoons in afghanistan by the end of 2013 rear adm sean pybus also added that the unit is already undergoing a transition back to its maritime roots by placing more emphasis on sea-based missions after being involved in mostly landlocked missions since 2001

==== al faw and iraqi oil infrastructureedit ====
several days before the beginning of the invasion of iraq two sdv teams were launched from mark v special operations craft in the persian gulf their objectives were the hydrographic reconnaissance of the al basrah (mabot) and khawr al amaya (kaaot) oil terminals after swimming under the terminals and securing their mark 8 mod 1s the sdv seals spent several hours taking pictures and surveying iraqi activity on both platforms before returning to their boats seals later secured several oil infrastructures on the al faw peninsula and the offshore oil terminals they helped clear the khawr abd allah and khawr az zubyar waterways which enabled humanitarian supplies to be delivered to the port of umm qasr
==== mukarayin damedit ====
coalition military planners were concerned that retreating iraqi forces would destroy the mukatayin hydroelectric dam northeast of baghdad in an attempt to slow advancing us troops in addition to restricting the maneuver of coalition forces the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area as well as cause massive flooding and loss of iraqi civilian life a mixed team of seals from seal team five and polish grom was called in to seize the dam this force was flown several hours by us air force mh-53 pave lows to the dam the seals employed dpvs into blocking positions to defend against counter-attack and roving bands of iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding iraqi towns as in al faw the seals found their dpvs to be ineffective and this marked the last time they would employ them in iraq
the seals and grom on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam the minimal iraqi security forces on site surrendered and with the exception of a grom soldier who broke an ankle during the insertion no casualties were sustained in the operation after several hours of searching the dam for remaining hostile forces or any explosives the seals secured the dam and were later relieved by advancing elements of the us army
=== maersk alabama hijackingedit ===

navy seal training pipeline
8-week naval special warfare prep school
24-week basic underwater demolition/seal (bud/s) training
3-week parachute jump school
26-week seal qualification training (sqt)
upon graduation from sqt trainees receive the coveted navy seal trident designating them as navy seals they are subsequently assigned to a seal team or seal delivery vehicle (sdv) team and begin 18-months of predeployment training before they are considered deployable this training consists of
6-month professional development - individual specialty training (prodev)
6-month unit level training (ult)
6-month squadron integration training (sit)
those enlisted seals with a medical rating will first attend the special operation combat medic course for 6 months in fort bragg north carolina before joining a team in order to become a seal medic those pursuing officer positions first attend the junior officer training course to learn about operations planning and how to perform team briefings in total it can take over 2.5 years to completely train a navy seal for his first deployment
=== womenedit ===
in august 2015 it was reported that the navy is planning to open its elite seal teams to women who can pass the grueling training regimen. adm jon greenert said he and the head of naval special warfare command rear adm brian losey believe that if women can pass the legendary six-month basic underwater demolition/seal training they should be allowed to serve. in august 2015 [f]inal approval [for admission of women] is still pending. on 3 december 2015 it was announced that there are now no exceptions to all military roles in the us and women can become a navy seal

=== seal teamsedit ===
seal teams are organized into two groups naval special warfare group one (west coast) and naval special warfare group two (east coast) which come under the command of naval special warfare command stationed at nab coronado california as of 2006 there are eight confirmed navy seal teams the original seal teams in the vietnam war were separated between west coast (team one) and east coast (team two) seals the current seal team deployments include teams 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 and 10 the most recent to come into being are seal team 7 and seal team 10 which were formed in march and april 2002 respectively
the teams deploy as naval special warfare squadrons or special operations task forces and can deploy anywhere in the world squadrons will normally be deployed and fall under a joint task force (jtf) or a combined joint special operations task force (cjsotf) as a special operations task force (sotf)
