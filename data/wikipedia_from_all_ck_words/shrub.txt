a shrub is a small to medium-sized woody plant it is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees depending on their growing conditions small low shrubs generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall such as lavender periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses are often termed subshrubs or bushes
an area of cultivated shrubs in a park or a garden is known as a shrubbery when clipped as topiary suitable species or varieties of shrubs develop dense foliage and many small leafy branches growing close together many shrubs respond well to renewal pruning in which hard cutting back to a stool results in long new stems known as canes other shrubs respond better to selective pruning to reveal their structure and character
shrubs in common garden practice are generally considered broad-leaved plants though some smaller conifers such as mountain pine and common juniper are also shrubby in structure species that grow into a shrubby habit may be either deciduous or evergreen
== shrubs as a botanical structural form ==
in botany and ecology a shrub is more specifically used to describe the particular physical structural or plant life-form of woody plants which are less than 8 metres (26 ft) high and usually have many stems arising at or near the base
for example a descriptive system widely adopted in australia is based on structural characteristics based on life-form plus the height and amount of foliage cover of the tallest layer or dominant species
for shrubs 28 metres (6.626.2 ft) high the following structural forms are categorized
dense foliage cover (70100%) closed-scrub
mid-dense foliage cover (3070%) open-scrub
sparse foliage cover (1030%) tall shrubland
very sparse foliage cover (<10%) tall open shrubland
for shrubs less than 2 metres (6.6 ft) high the following structural forms are categorized
dense foliage cover (70100%) closed-heath or closed low shrubland(north america)
mid-dense foliage cover (3070%) open-heath or mid-dense low shrubland(north america)
sparse foliage cover (1030%) low shrubland
very sparse foliage cover (<10%) low open shrubland
