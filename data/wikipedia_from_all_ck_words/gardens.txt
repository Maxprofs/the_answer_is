a garden is a planned space usually outdoors set aside for the display cultivation and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature the garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials the most common form today is known as a residential garden but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one zoos which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats were formerly called zoological gardens western gardens are almost universally based on plants with garden often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden
some traditional types of eastern gardens such as zen gardens use plants sparsely or not at all xeriscape gardens use local native plants that do not require irrigation or extensive use of other resources while still providing the benefits of a garden environment gardens may exhibit structural enhancements sometimes called follies including water features such as fountains ponds (with or without fish) waterfalls or creeks dry creek beds statuary arbors trellises and more
some gardens are for ornamental purposes only while some gardens also produce food crops sometimes in separate areas or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale more labor-intensive methods and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby rather than produce for sale) flower gardens combine plants of different heights colors textures and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses
gardening is the activity of growing and maintaining the garden this work is done by an amateur or professional gardener a gardener might also work in a non-garden setting such as a park a roadside embankment or other public space landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to specialise in design for public and corporate clients

== garden design ==
garden design is the creation of plans for the layout and planting of gardens and landscapes gardens may be designed by garden owners themselves or by professionals professional garden designers tend to be trained in principles of design and horticulture and have a knowledge and experience of using plants some professional garden designers are also landscape architects a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license
elements of garden design include the layout of hard landscape such as paths rockeries walls water features sitting areas and decking as well as the plants themselves with consideration for their horticultural requirements their season-to-season appearance lifespan growth habit size speed of growth and combinations with other plants and landscape features consideration is also given to the maintenance needs of the garden including the time or funds available for regular maintenance which can affect the choices of plants regarding speed of growth spreading or self-seeding of the plants whether annual or perennial and bloom-time and many other characteristics garden design can be roughly divided into two groups formal and naturalistic gardens
the most important consideration in any garden design is how the garden will be used followed closely by the desired stylistic genres and the way the garden space will connect to the home or other structures in the surrounding areas all of these considerations are subject to the limitations of the budget budget limitations can be addressed by a simpler garden style with fewer plants and less costly hardscape materials seeds rather than sod for lawns and plants that grow quickly alternatively garden owners may choose to create their garden over time area by area
== elements of a garden ==
most gardens consist of a mix of natural and constructed elements although even very natural gardens are always an inherently artificial creation natural elements present in a garden principally comprise flora (such as trees and weeds) fauna (such as arthropods and birds) soil water air and light constructed elements include paths patios decking sculptures drainage systems lights and buildings (such as sheds gazebos pergolas and follies) but also living constructions such as flower beds ponds and lawns

== environmental impacts of gardens ==
gardeners may cause environmental damage by the way they garden or they may enhance their local environment damage by gardeners can include direct destruction of natural habitats when houses and gardens are created indirect habitat destruction and damage to provide garden materials such as peat rock for rock gardens and by the use of tapwater to irrigate gardens the death of living beings in the garden itself such as the killing not only of slugs and snails but also their predators such as hedgehogs and song thrushes by metaldehyde slug killer the death of living beings outside the garden such as local species extinction by indiscriminate plant collectors and climate change caused by greenhouse gases produced by gardening
== watering gardens ==
some gardeners manage their gardens without using any water from outside the garden and therefore do not deprive wetland habitats of the water they need to survive examples in britain include ventnor botanic garden on the isle of wight and parts of beth chatto's garden in essex sticky sticky wicket in dorset and the royal horticultural society's gardens at harlow carr and hyde hall rain gardens absorb rainfall falling onto nearby hard surfaces rather than sending it into stormwater drains for irrigation see rainwater sprinkler system drip irrigation tap water greywater hand pump and watering can
== wildlife in gardens ==
chris baines's classic book how to make a wildlife garden was first published in 1985 and is still a good source of advice on how to create and manage a wildlife garden
== climate change and gardens ==
climate change will have many impacts on gardens most of them negative and these are detailed in gardening in the global greenhouse by richard bisgrove and paul hadley gardens also contribute to climate change greenhouse gases can be produced by gardeners in many ways the three main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide gardeners produce carbon dioxide directly by overcultivating soil and destroying soil carbon by burning garden waste on bonfires by using power tools which burn fossil fuel or use electricity generated by fossil fuels and by using peat gardeners produce methane by compacting the soil and making it anaerobic and by allowing their compost heaps to become compacted and anaerobic gardeners produce nitrous oxide by applying excess nitrogen fertiliser when plants are not actively growing so that the nitrogen in the fertiliser is converted by soil bacteria to nitrous oxide gardeners can help to prevent climate change in many ways including the use of trees shrubs ground cover plants and other perennial plants in their gardens turning garden waste into soil organic matter instead of burning it keeping soil and compost heaps aerated avoiding peat switching from power tools to hand tools or changing their garden design so that power tools are not needed and using nitrogen-fixing plants instead of nitrogen fertiliser
