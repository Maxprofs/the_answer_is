a brush is a tool with bristles wire or other filaments used for cleaning grooming hair make up painting surface finishing and for many other purposes it is one of the most basic and versatile tools known to mankind and the average household may contain several dozen varieties it generally consists of a handle or block to which filaments are affixed either parallel- or perpendicular-wise depending on the way the brush is to be gripped during use the material of both the block and bristles or filaments is chosen to withstand hazards of its application such as corrosive chemicals heat or abrasion
== manufactureedit ==
a common way of setting the bristles brush filaments in the brush is the staple or anchor set brush in which the filament is forced with a staple by the middle into a hole with a special driver and held there by the pressure against all of the walls of the hole and the portions of the staple nailed to the bottom of the hole the staple can be replaced with a kind of anchor which is a piece of rectangular profile wire that is anchored to the wall of the hole like in most toothbrushes another way to attach the bristles to the surface can be found in the fused brush in which instead of being inserted into a hole a plastic fibre is welded to another plastic surface giving the option to use different diameters of bristles in the same brush
configurations include twisted-in wire (e.g bottle brushes) cylinders and disks (with bristles spread in one face or radially)
