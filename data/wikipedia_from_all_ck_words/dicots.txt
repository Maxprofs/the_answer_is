== history ==
=== ancient and medieval ===
the area around present-day didcot has been inhabited for at least 9000 years a large scale archaeological dig between 20102013 produced finds from the mesolithic neolithic iron age and bronze ages during the roman era the inhabitants of the area tried to drain the marshland by digging ditches through what is now the ladygrove area north of the town near long wittenham evidence of which was found during surveying in 1994 a hoard of 126 gold roman coins dating to around 160 ce was found just outside the village in 1995 by an enthusiast with a metal detector this is now displayed at the ashmolean museum on loan from the british museum
in early historical records didcot was recorded as dudcote and doudecothe amongst other similar names deriving from the personal name dydda and the anglosaxon word for house or shelter cott the name is believed to be derived from that of dida a 7th-century mercian sub-king who ruled the area around oxford and was the father of saint frithuswith now the patron saint of both oxford and oxford university didcot was then a rural berkshire village and remained that way for centuries only occasionally appearing in records at the time of the domesday book in 1086 didcot was much smaller than several surrounding villages including harwell and long wittenham which are now dwarfed by modern didcot didcot was not explicitly named in the domesday book with the closest recorded settlement being wibalditone with 21 inhabitants and a church the name possibly survives in willington's farm on the edge of didcot's present-day ladygrove estate parts of the original village still exist in the lydalls road area where the church of england parish church of all saints is located the church's nave walls dates from 1160
=== early modern era ===
in the 1500s didcot was a small village of landowners tenants and tradespeople with a population of around 120 the oldest house still standing in didcot is white cottage a grade ii listed wood shingle roofed timber-framed building on manor road which was built in the early 16th century at this time the village centre consisted of a collection of small houses and surrounding farms around manor foxhall and lydalls roads those still standing include the nook thorney down cottage and manor cottage which were all constructed in the early to mid-17th century didcot village was on the route between london and wantage (present day wantage road) and hosted three turnpikes (toll gates) these brought in revenue for local landowners and gentry and operated between 1752 and 1879 when they were abolished due to the growing use of the railway
=== 19th & 20th centuries introduction of the railway ===
==== great western railway ====
the great western railway engineered by isambard kingdom brunel reached didcot in 1839 in 1844 the brunel-designed didcot station was opened the original station burnt down in the later part of 19th century the more obvious alignment for the original line to bristol would have been abingdon-on-thames slightly farther north but the landowner lord wantage is reputed to have prevented the railway coming close to the town this and the junction of the great western line to oxford created the conditions for the future growth of didcot the station's name also finally fixed the spelling of didcot
==== didcot newbury and southampton railway ====
didcot's junction of the routes to london bristol oxford and to southampton via the didcot newbury and southampton railway (dn&s) made the town of strategic importance to military logistics in particular during the first world war campaign on the western front and the second world war preparations for d-day the dn&s line has since closed and the sites of the large army and royal air force ordnance depots that were built to serve these needs have disappeared beneath the power station and milton park business park
remains of the didcot newbury and southampton railway are still in evidence in the eastern part of town this line designed to provide a direct link to the south coast from the midlands and the north avoiding the convuluted reading/basingstoke route was constructed from 18791882 after previous proposals had floundered it was designed as a main line and was engineered by john fowler and built by contractors t.h falkiner and sir thomas tancred who together also constructed the forth bridge it was an very expensive line to build due to the heavy engineering challenges of crossing the berkshire and hampshire downs with a ruling 1 in 106 gradient to allow for higher mainline speeds and this over-capitalisation coupled with initial traffic barely meeting expectations caused the company financial problems meaning it never reached southampton of its own accord but had to join the main london and south western railway line at shawford south of winchester
however from the outbreak of world war ii such was the growth of wartime traffic to the port of southampton a decision was made to upgrade the line which included the complete doubling of the northern section between didcot and newbury closing for 5 months in 1942/3 while this was carried out several of the bridges in the didcot/hagbourne area were also strengthened and rebuilt
although passenger trains between didcot and newbury were withdrawn in 1962 the line continued to be used by freight trains for a further four years up to 11 trains a day each way according to some observers and oil traffic to the north from the refinery at fawley near southampton was a regular feature in 1966 however this traffic also was withdrawn and the line was then dismantled the last passenger train was of all things a re-routed pines express in may 1964 diverted due to a derailment at reading west a section of the abandoned embankment towards upton now designated as a sustrans route has views across the town and countryside and is popular with walkers
=== 21st century ===

didcot has been designated as one of the three major growth areas in oxfordshire the ladygrove development is set to double the number of dwellings in the town since construction began in the late 1980s to the north and east of the railway line on the former marshland originally the ladygrove development was planned to be complete by 2001 but the plans for the final section to the east of abingdon road were only announced in 2006 in anticipation of the completion of the ladygrove development a prolonged and contentious planning enquiry decided that a 3,200 dwelling development will now be built to the west of the town partly overlapping the boundary with the vale of white horse
in 2008 a new 8 million arts and entertainment centre cornerstone opened within the orchard centre it contains exhibition and studio spaces a cafe and a 236-seat auditorium designed by ellis william architects the centre is clad with silvered aluminium panels and features a window wall used to connect the building with passing shoppers
