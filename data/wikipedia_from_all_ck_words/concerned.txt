== background ==
christopher livingston started working on concerned as a hobby he had previously considered developing a webcomic that would parallel the storyline of a game from start to finish based on the original 1987 legend of zelda for the nintendo entertainment system he chose the half-life 2 game world as the scene for his comic because he was a fan and because the availability of garry's mod eliminated the need to draw by hand he always intended the plot of the comic to end at the same point as the game
livingston thought a comic would be a good way to introduce humor to the game which he has described as mysterious moody [and] immersive
well i thought half-life 2 was a great game but there simply weren't enough jokes about toilets in it so i thought a comic would be a good place to get some humor into the game i came up with the idea for frohman a complete idiot to play all the way through the game just like freeman only instead of being a hero he'd be a complete fool
== publication history ==
the first issue of concerned was released on may 1 2005 the comic completing its run on november 6 2006 with a total of 205 issues the characters in the comic were posed using garry's mod a tool which facilitates manipulation of the source engine used by half-life 2 and the comic frames were assembled using photoshop 6
the webcomic derives its name from one of the propaganda broadcasts by wallace breen in half-life 2 in which he is reading a letter supposedly written by a citizen signed sincerely a concerned citizen and begins his response with thank you for writing concerned throughout the comic the main character gordon frohman sends several similar letters to dr breen livingston's intention being to suggest that frohman was the author of the letter read by breen in half-life 2 the name frohman is derived from the last name of gordon freeman the protagonist of the half-life series according to the credits on the comic's website this name was suggested to livingston by sam golgert an acquaintance of his
livingston has also employed the assistance of other people notably michael clements founder of the half-life 2 comics repository phwonline and creator of sketch another comic based on half-life 2 clements aided him in enhancing the presentation of concerned greg galcik creator of spinnwebe also assisted in site maintenance and livingston later offered him a guest week special in which galcik wrote and published three issues for concerned a similar set of three issues have also been published by joe yuska during a week when livingston was unavailable
as stated by livingston in several interviews his relation with valve the developer company of half-life 2 was a good one the company being pleased to have a comic based on their game according to livingston valve also intended on collaborating with him to produce printed copies of concerned however this was never finalized as the resolution of the comics was too low for printing
livingston has said that the comic will not continue through half-life 2 episode one the first of an episodic series following half-life 2 as the game doesn't really lend itself to the type of comic [he wants] to do
== synopsis ==
=== introduction ===
in half-life 2 the player takes on the role of dr gordon freeman throughout the game the player follows the story of a dark dystopian future in which mankind has been enslaved by the combine a mysterious alien enemy in contrast concerned follows the same general path through the story established by half-life 2 but instead follows the adventures of gordon frohman a hapless lethally clumsy oaf who arrives in city 17 a few weeks before freeman frohman is incredibly nave and unlike the other citizens seems to enjoy living under the rule of the totalitarian administrator dr breen and the combine he holds an insane reverence for the latter even going to the point of having a plush doll of a combine soldier
=== plot ===
the early phases of the comic have frohman excitedly arriving in city 17 eventually he takes a job at the combine's headquarters the citadel under a combine elite named mr henderson as most of his human colleagues become combine soldiers he realizes that henderson has no immediate intention to do the same for him citing his incompetence demanding to become one with the combine frohman willingly sets off to nova prospekt an alien security and detention installation for invasive surgery to convert him meanwhile he selects ravenholm as a residence where he can commute to and from city 17 but lacks proper transport with which to get there after a failed attempt to reach ravenholm using dr isaac kleiner's teleporter leaves him stuck in a counter-strike source server for a week he seeks ravenholm by foot instead traveling through city 17's canals frohman arrives badly injured and dazed at black mesa east the headquarters of the human resistance where he is welcomed as a helper his stay there is cut short because he causes trouble in the base and also irritatingly overuses the gravity gun he is fooled into leaving the base and finally heads toward and reaches ravenholm
on frohman's arrival ravenholm is depicted as a peaceful bright and cheerful place devoid of any combine elements but terrorized by father grigori after adjusting gordon becomes accustomed to the town but unintentionally discloses the town's location to dr breen who immediately orders his forces to bomb the shit out of them the town is fired on with headcrabs killing many and turning others into zombies frohman himself is attacked by a headcrab and turns into a zombie too yet retains his free will and after a while his headcrab dies of malnutrition which is attributed to his lack of intelligence with father grigori's help frohman escapes ravenholm now the zombie-infested nightmare seen when freeman visits it in the game and presses on to nova prospekt after surviving several more hazards he reaches the coast here after passing the final resistance base and an antlion-infested beach frohman encounters an antlion guard which is killed by a vortigaunt an alien race helping the humans in the game this allows frohman to retrieve bugbait from the dead creature with which he can control the antlions
frohman accompanied by several bugbait-controlled antlions eventually reaches nova prospekt only to be turned away as he does not have an appointment he gives up and returns to city 17 in the following strip as gordon freeman finally arrives in the city linking the comic's time frame with the start of half-life 2 he is then drafted into the resistance after failing to disrupt its operations and unintentionally signals the start of the resistance's uprising after one of his antlions accidentally kills a combine police officer during the fighting he accompanies freeman himself and mingles with resistance members aids the combine in the capture of alyx vance one of freeman's allies and reunites with norman frohman his long-lost assassin twin brother only to promptly witness his death at the hands of a strider a large tripodal assault synth
following this gordon returns to the citadel unwillingly aiding freeman in his journey up the citadel and influencing the plot of the game as freeman is pursuing dr breen to his teleporter frohman is about to kill freemanbut he pauses to come up with the perfect one-liner for the occasion causing him to run out of time dr breen's teleporter explodes and frohman is flung off the citadel peak by the explosion dr breen also survives having fallen from the citadel onto a pile of dead combine soldiers however frohman falls right onto breen killing him gordon himself is only seriously injured baffled by his ability to survive he realizes through a flashback that he has been under buddha mode a cheat code which prevents his health points from dropping below one throughout the comic's duration frohman inadvertently turns off the mode and even spoils an opportunity to be rescued by a group of vortigaunts as both gordon freeman and alyx vance are at the start of episode one in the end frohman dies unceremoniously while survivors of the city 17 uprising find him dead
== themes ==
livingston stated that the comic was a good way of pointing out several shortcomings of video games and first-person shooters in particular he emphasized the presence of various objects throughout the levels of games which were intended to aid the player but would have little chance of being found in the real world in a similar manner
there's a lot of elements about video games to poke fun of especially in first-person shooters which all have a lot of things in common such as health kits ammo and barrels filled with explosive material strewn about levels for no practical real-world reason it just seemed like a good setting to make jokes
much of the comic's dark humor is derived from its contrasts with half-life 2 in a depressing dark vision of a conquered humanity's future gordon freeman becomes a hero and savior the similarly named gordon frohman on the other hand is just an average person improbably cheerful to the point of stupidity and somewhat nave as to what is actually going on around him for instance frohman fails to realize that his return-addressed letters to doctor breen reveal his location and so result in that location being invaded bombed or otherwise compromised
the comic contains many references to events and objects in the game in one comic frohman makes a clerical error that causes the combine to order far too many explosive barrels thus suggesting an explanation for the barrels ubiquity throughout city 17 and beyond in another he writes a letter to dr breen asking why using his flashlight reduces his ability to run a reference to half-life 2's flashlight and sprint functions using the same power source in a further strip the town of ravenholm becomes the headcrab-infested ghost town seen in half-life 2 after frohman writes to breen expressing his happiness with being there giving away ravenholm's location indeed frohman causes (intentionally or accidentally) many of the disastrous circumstances that gordon freeman runs across he accidentally gives breen the idea of headcrab shells while on a radio and sets up all of the traps in ravenholm himself in an attempt to catch father grigori
it is also revealed that at the black mesa research facility frohman causes the resonance cascade that allows for alien forces to invade in half-life by accidentally delivering a wedge of cheese instead of the intended test sample to the test chamber where the cascade flashpoints half-life decay however indicates that dr gina cross is responsible for this task livingston admitted he did not play decay and thus was not aware of its storyline he also stated that the comic takes place in the pc version of the half-life continuity and since half-life decay was never published for the pc it does not affect the comic
== reception ==
the comic has had positive reception from both the public and editors of various gaming magazines the globe and mail stated the comic stands out from most other gamics [comics consisting of game screenshots] by virtue of the quality of its writing and presentation online magazine ggl.com said that concerned is one of the funnier online gaming comics and perhaps the best single-game parody in the bunch and the irish gamers described concerned as a hit webcomic computer gaming world called the comic funny while pc zone described it as mildly amusing the comic had also caught the attention of reviewers outside the united states and the united kingdom the romanian magazine level said the comic is a recommendation to every fan of the game and anyone looking for a good daily laugh
the comic's popularity as well as the fact that livingston stated he does not intend to continue the comic through half-life 2 episode one led to the appearance of an unofficial sequel to concerned entitled concerned 2 a concerned rip-off the continuing adventures of gordon frohman and created by norman n black although it is currently on an undisclosed hiatus since november 28 2010
