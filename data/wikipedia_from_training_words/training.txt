training is teaching or developing in oneself or others any skills and knowledge that relate to specific useful competencies training has specific goals of improving one's capability capacity productivity and performance it forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics) in addition to the basic training required for a trade occupation or profession observers of the labor-market recognize as of 2008 the need to continue training beyond initial qualifications to maintain upgrade and update skills throughout working life people within many professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as professional development
== typesedit ==
=== physical trainingedit ===
physical training concentrates on mechanistic goals training-programs in this area develop specific skills or muscles often with a view of peaking at a particular time some physical training programs focus on raising overall physical fitness
in military use training means gaining the physical ability to perform and survive in combat and learning the many skills needed in a time of war these include how to use a variety of weapons outdoor survival skills and how to survive being captured by the enemy among many others see military education and training
for psychological or physiological reasons people who believe it may be beneficial to them can choose to practice relaxation training or autogenic training in an attempt to increase their ability to relax or deal with stress while some studies have indicated relaxation training is useful for some medical conditions autogenic training has limited results or has been the result of few studies
=== job training and developmentedit ===
some commentators use a similar term for workplace learning to improve performance training and development there are also additional services available online for those who wish to receive training above and beyond that which is offered by their employers some examples of these services include career counseling skill assessment and supportive services one can generally categorize such training as on-the-job or off-the-job
the on-the-job training method takes place in a normal working situation using the actual tools equipment documents or materials that trainees will use when fully trained on-the-job training has a general reputation as most effective for vocational work.it involves employee training at the place of work while he or she is doing the actual job usually a professional trainer (or sometimes an experienced employee) serves as the course instructor using hands-on training often supported by formal classroom training sometimes training can occur by using web based technology or video conferencing tools
off-the-job training method takes place away from normal work situations implying that the employee does not count as a directly productive worker while such training takes place off-the-job training method also involves employee training at a site away from the actual work environment it often utilizes lectures case studies role playing and simulation having the advantage of allowing people to get away from work and concentrate more thoroughly on the training itself this type of training has proven more effective in inculcating concepts and ideas many personnel selection companies offer a service which would help to improve employee competences and change the attitude towards job the internal personnel training topics can vary from effective problem solving skills to leadership training
a more recent development in job training is the on the job training plan or ojt plan according to the united states department of the interior a proper ojt plan should include an overview of the subjects to be covered the number of hours the training is expected to take an estimated completion date and a method by which the training will be evaluated
=== religion and spiritualityedit ===
in religious and spiritual use training may refer to the purification of the mind heart understanding and actions to obtain a variety of spiritual goals such as (for example) closeness to god or freedom from suffering note for example the institutionalized spiritual training of threefold training in buddhism meditation in hinduism or discipleship in christianity these aspects of training can be short term or last a lifetime depending on the context of the training and which religious group it is a part of
compare religious ritual
=== parochial schoolsedit ===
parochial schools are a fairly widespread institution in the united states a parochial school is a primary or secondary school supervised by a religious organization especially a roman catholic day school affiliated with a parish or a holy order as of 2004 out of the approximately 50 million children who were enrolled in american grade schools 4.2 million children attend a church-affiliated school which is approximately 1 in 12 students within the christian religion for example one can attend a church-affiliated college with the intent of getting a degree in a field associated with religious studies some people may also attend church-affiliated colleges in pursuit of a non-religious degree and typically do it just to deepen their understanding of the specific religion that the school is associated with the largest non-public school system in the united states the catholic school system operates 5,744 elementary schools and 1,206 secondary schools
=== artificial-intelligence feedbackedit ===
researchers have developed training-methods for artificial-intelligence devices as well evolutionary algorithms including genetic programming and other methods of machine learning use a system of feedback based on fitness functions to allow computer programs to determine how well an entity performs a task the methods construct a series of programs known as a population of programs and then automatically test them for fitness observing how well they perform the intended task the system automatically generates new programs based on members of the population that perform the best these new members replace programs that perform the worst the procedure repeats until the achievement of optimum performance in robotics such a system can continue to run in real-time after initial training allowing robots to adapt to new situations and to changes in themselves for example due to wear or damage researchers have also developed robots that can appear to mimic simple human behavior as a starting point for training
