=== emergence of debating societies ===
debating societies emerged in london in the early eighteenth century and soon became a prominent fixture of national life the origins of these societies are not certain in many cases however by the mid-18th century london fostered an active debating society culture debating topics covered a broad spectrum of topics while the debating societies allowed participants from both genders and all social backgrounds making them an excellent example of the enlarged public sphere of the age of enlightenment debating societies were a phenomenon associated with the simultaneous rise of the public sphere a sphere of discussion separate from traditional authorities and accessible to all people that acted as a platform for criticism and the development of new ideas and philosophy
john henley a clergyman founded an oratory in 1726 with the principal purpose of reforming the manner in which such public presentations should be performed. he made extensive use of the print industry to advertise the events of his oratory making it an omnipresent part of the london public sphere henley was also instrumental in constructing the space of the debating club he added two platforms to his room in the newport district of london to allow for the staging of debates and structured the entrances to allow for the collection of admission these changes were further implemented when henley moved his enterprise to lincoln's inn fields the public was now willing to pay to be entertained and henley exploited this increasing commercialization of british society by the 1770s debating societies were firmly established in london society
the year 1785 was pivotal the morning chronicle announced on march 27
in 1780 35 differently named societies advertised and hosted debates for anywhere between 650 and 1200 people the question for debate was introduced by a president or moderator who proceeded to regulate the discussion speakers were given set amounts of time to argue their point of view and at the end of the debate a vote was taken to determine a decision or adjourn the question for further debate speakers were not permitted to slander or insult other speakers or diverge from the topic at hand again illustrating the value placed on politeness by late 18th century debaters

however in announcing its withdrawal from sponsoring the debates the league of women voters stated that it was withdrawing because the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the american voter. in 2004 the citizens debate commission was formed in the hope of establishing an independent sponsor for presidential debates with a more voter-centric role in the definition of the participants format and rules

=== online debating ===
with the increasing popularity and availability of the internet differing opinions arise frequently though they are often expressed via flaming and other forms of argumentation which consist primarily of assertions formalized debating websites do exist the debate style varies from site to site with local communities and cultures developing some sites promote a contentious atmosphere that can border on flaming (the personal insult of your opponent also known as a type of ad hominem fallacy) while others strictly police such activities and strongly promote independent research and more structured arguments
rule sets on various sites usually serve to enforce or create the culture envisioned by the site's owner or in some more open communities the community itself policing post content style and structure combine with frequent use of reward systems (such as reputation titles and forum permissions) to promote activities seen as productive while discouraging unwelcomed actions these cultures vary sufficiently that most styles can find a home some online debate communities and forums practice policy debate through uploaded speeches and preset word counts to represent time limits present in physical debate these virtual debates typically feature long periods of theoretical prep time as well as the ability to research during a round
originally most debate sites were little more than online or bulletin boards since then site-specific development has become increasingly common in facilitating different debate styles examples of more established sites include the online debate network debate.org and createdebate certain other sites have tended to be based on various debating niches - for instance naqeshny arose in egypt out of the arab spring movement meevsu is based on the emerging technology of live video debate and edeb8 has a focus on emulating the real-world debating experience
