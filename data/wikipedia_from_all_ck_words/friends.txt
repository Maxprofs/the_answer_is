== productionedit ==
=== conceptionedit ===
david crane and marta kauffman began developing three new television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom family album was cancelled by cbs in 1993 kauffman and crane decided to pitch the series about six people in their 20s making their way in manhattan to nbc since they thought it would fit best there crane and kauffman presented the idea to their production partner kevin bright who had served as executive producer on their hbo series dream on the idea for the series was conceived when crane and kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in new york kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was more of a question mark. they found the concept to be interesting as they believed everybody knows that feeling and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time the team titled the series insomnia cafe and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to nbc in december 1993
at the same time warren littlefield the then-president of nbc entertainment was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends who had become new surrogate family members. however littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life and found the scripts developed by nbc to be terrible when kauffman crane and bright pitched insomnia cafe littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were nbc bought the idea as a put pilot meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed kauffman and crane began writing a pilot script for a show now titled friends like us which took three days to write littlefield wanted the series to represent generation x and explore a new kind of tribal bonding but the trio did not share his vision crane argued that it was not a series for one generation and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching nbc liked the pilot script and ordered the series under another title six of one mainly due to the similar title it shared with the abc sitcom these friends of mine
=== castingedit ===
once it became apparent that the series was a favored project at nbc littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town wanting their client to be a part of the series auditions for the lead roles took place in new york and los angeles the casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75 those who received a callback read again in front of crane kauffman and bright at the end of march the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part and were asked to read for les moonves then-president of warner bros television
having worked with david schwimmer in the past the series creators wrote the character of ross with him in mind and he was the first actor cast cox wanted to play the role of monica but the producers had her in mind to play rachel because of her cheery upbeat energy which was not how they envisioned monica after cox's audition though kauffman agreed with cox and she got the role when matt leblanc auditioned for joey he put a different spin on the character the writers did not originally intend for joey to be dim but found it to be a major source of comedy leblanc also gave the character heart which the writers did not realize joey had although crane and kauffman did not want leblanc for the role at the time they were told by the network to cast him jennifer aniston matthew perry and lisa kudrow were cast based on their auditions
more changes occurred to the series storylines during the casting process the writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season kauffman acknowledged that joey's character became this whole new being and that it wasn't until we did the first thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun monica's neuroses are.
=== writingedit ===
in the weeks after nbc's pick up of friends crane kauffman and bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series mainly unproduced seinfeld episodes kauffman and crane hired a team of seven young writers because when you're 40 you can't do it anymore the networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college. the creators felt that using six equal characters rather than emphasizing one or two would allow for myriad storylines and give the show legs. the majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers although the actors added ideas the writers originally planned a big love story between joey and monica as they intended them to be the most sexual of the characters in the series pitch the idea of a romantic interest between ross and rachel emerged during the period when kauffman and crane wrote the pilot script
during production of the pilot nbc requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones but the writers refused wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight nbc thought the cast was too young and pushed for an older character who could give the young adults advice crane and kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured pat the cop. crane found the storyline to be terrible and kauffman joked you know the kids book pat the bunny we had pat the cop. nbc eventually relented and dropped the idea
each summer (june july and august in the us) the producers would outline the storylines for the subsequent season before an episode went into production kauffman and crane would revise the script written by another writer mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign unlike other storylines the idea for a relationship between joey and rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season the creators did not want ross and rachel to get back together so soon and while looking for a romantic impediment a writer suggested joey's romantic interest in rachel the storyline was incorporated into the season however when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable the storyline was wrapped up until it again resurfaced in the season's finale for the ninth season the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to rachel's baby as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season kauffman and crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season even if all the cast members had wanted to continue
the episode title format"the one..."was created when the producers realized that the episode titles would not be featured in the opening credits and therefore would be unknown to most of the audience episode titles officially begin with the one... except the title of the pilot episode and the series finale the last one.
=== filmingedit ===
the first season was shot on stage 5 at warner bros studios in burbank california nbc executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner but eventually consented to the coffee house concept the opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the warner bros ranch at 4:00 am while it was particularly cold for a burbank morning at the beginning of the second season production moved to the larger stage 24 which was renamed the friends stage after the series finale filming for the series began during the summer (june july and august in the us) of 1994 in front of a live audience who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters a hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes each 22-minute episode took six hours to filmtwice the length of most sitcom tapingsmainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script
although the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location friends was never shot in new york bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny even when shooting on the lot outside and that the live audience was an integral part of the series when the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting new york with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras lighting and for the audience to be able to see what's going on the apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the funny scripts the fourth season finale was shot on location in london because the producers were aware of the series popularity in the uk the scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people these were the show's largest audiences throughout its run the fifth season finale set in las vegas was filmed at warner bros studios although bright met people who thought it was filmed on location
== series finaleedit ==
the series creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in january 2004 four months before its original airing crane kauffman and bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline paying attention to what worked and what did not they liked the ones that stayed true to the series citing the finale of the mary tyler moore show as the gold standard crane kauffman and bright had difficulty writing the finale and spent several days thinking about the final scene without being able to write a word they did not want to do something high concept or take the show out of the show. the most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members the main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly
it's exactly what i had hoped we all end up with a sense of a new beginning and the audience has a sense that it's a new chapter in the lives of all these characters
nbc heavily promoted the series finale which was preceded by weeks of media hype local nbc affiliates organized viewing parties around the u.s. including an event at universal citywalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor astrovision screen the finale was the subject of two episodes of dateline nbc a weekly television newsmagazine one of which ran for two hours a one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode following the finale the tonight show with jay leno was filmed on the set of the friends central perk coffee house which featured the series cast as guests the advertising rates for the finale averaged $2 million for 30 seconds of commercial time breaking the record held by the seinfeld finale at $1.7 million
in the u.s. 52.5 million viewers watched the finale on may 6 2004 making it the most watched entertainment telecast since the seinfeld finale in 1998 although it was not the series most watched episode the finale was the fourth most watched series finale in television history only behind the finales of m*a*s*h cheers and seinfeld which were respectively watched by 105 80.4 and 76.2 million viewers the retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36 million viewers and the finale was the second most watched television broadcast of the year only behind the super bowl following the finales of friends and frasier media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre expressed opinions varied between a signaling of the end of the sitcom genre a small decline in the large history of the genre and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows
== receptionedit ==
=== critical receptionedit ===
early reviews of the series were mixed and holds a metacritic score of 59 out of 100 based on 20 sampled reviews indicating mixed to average reviews. tom feran of the plain dealer wrote that the series traded vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of seinfeld while ann hodges of the houston chronicle called it the new seinfeld wannabe but it will never be as funny as seinfeld. in the los angeles daily news ray richmond named the series as one of the brighter comedies of the new season and the los angeles times called it flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.
chicago sun-times ginny holbert found joey and rachel's characteristics to be underdeveloped while richmond commended the cast as a likeable youth ensemble with good chemistry. robert bianco of usa today was complimentary of schwimmer calling him terrific. he also praised the female leads but was concerned that perry's role as chandler was undefined and that leblanc was relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it. the authors of friends like us the unofficial guide to friends thought that the cast was trying just a little too hard in particular perry and schwimmer
as the series progressed reviews became more positive and friends became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time it is now often ranked among the all-time best tv shows critics commended the series as having consistently sharp writing and chemistry between the main actors noel holston of newsday who had dismissed the pilot as a so-so seinfeld wannabe in 1994 repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode and felt like writing an apology to the writers heather havrilesky of salon.com thought that the series hit its stride in the second season havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be original and innovative. bill carter of the new york times called the eighth season a truly stunning comeback. carter found that by generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs the series made its way back into the hearts of its fans. however liane bonin of entertainment weekly felt that the direction of the ninth season was a disappointing buzzkill criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory although disappointed with the season bonin noted that the writing [was] still sharp. havrilesky thought that the tenth season was alarmingly awful far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be. friends was featured on time's list of the 100 best tv shows of all-time saying the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself friends and was really about family.
reviews of the series finale were mixed usa today's robert bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while highlighting each of the stars sarah rodman of the boston herald praised aniston and schwimmer for their acting but felt that their characters reunion was a bit too neat even if it was what most of the show's legions of fans wanted. roger catlin of the hartford courant felt that newcomers to the series would be surprised at how laughless the affair could be and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters. ken parish perkins writing for fort worth star-telegram pointed out that the finale was more touching than comical more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny.
