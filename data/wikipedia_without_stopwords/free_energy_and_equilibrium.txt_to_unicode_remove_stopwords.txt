chemistry standard molar entropy entropy content one mole substance standard conditions standard temperature pressure
standard molar entropy usually given symbol units joules per mole kelvin j mol k unlike standard enthalpies formation value absolute element standard state nonzero value room temperature entropy pure crystalline structure j mol k k according third law thermodynamics however presupposes material forms perfect crystal without frozen entropy defects dislocations never completely true crystals always grow finite temperature residual entropy often quite negligible
