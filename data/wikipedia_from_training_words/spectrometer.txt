in physics a spectrometer is an apparatus to measure a spectrum generally a spectrum is a graph that shows intensity as a function of wavelength of frequency of energy of momentum or of mass
== optical spectrometeredit ==
optical spectrometers (often simply called spectrometers") in particular show the intensity of light as a function of wavelength or of frequency the deflection is produced either by refraction in a prism or by diffraction in a diffraction grating
== mass spectrometeredit ==
a mass spectrometer is an analytical instrument that is used to identify the amount and type of chemicals present in a sample by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio and abundance of gas-phase ions
== time-of-flight spectrometeredit ==
the energy spectrum of particles of known mass can also be measured by determining the time of flight between two detectors (and hence the velocity) in a time-of-flight spectrometer alternatively if the velocity is known masses can be determined in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer
== magnetic spectrometeredit ==
when a fast charged particle (charge q mass m) enters a constant magnetic field b at right angles it is deflected into a circular path of radius r due to the lorentz force the momentum p of the particle is then given by
where m and v are mass and velocity of the particle the focussing principle of the oldest and simplest magnetic spectrometer the semicircular spectrometer invented by j k danisz is shown on the left a constant magnetic field is perpendicular to the page charged particles of momentum p that pass the slit are deflected into circular paths of radius r = p/qb evidently they hit the horizontal line at nearly the same place the focus where a particle counter should be placed varying b this makes possible to measure the energy spectrum of alpha particles in an alpha particle spectrometer of beta particles in a beta particle spectrometer of particles (e.g. fast ions) in a particle spectrometer or to measure the relative content of the various masses in a mass spectrometer
since danysz time many types of magnetic spectrometers more complicated than the semicircular type have been devised
== resolutionedit ==
generally the resolution of an instrument tells us how well two close-lying energies (or wavelengths or frequencies or masses) can be resolved generally for an instrument with mechanical slits higher resolution will mean lower intensity
