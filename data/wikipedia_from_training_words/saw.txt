a saw is a tool consisting of a tough blade wire or chain with a hard toothed edge it is used to cut through material most often wood the cut is made by placing the toothed edge against the material and moving it forcefully forth and less forcefully back or continuously forward this force may be applied by hand or powered by steam water electricity or other power source an abrasive saw has a powered circular blade designed to cut through metal
== terminology ==
heel the end closest to the handle
toe the end farthest from the handle
front the side with the teeth (the bottom edge")
back the side opposite the front (the top edge")
teeth small sharp protrusions along the cutting side of the saw
gullet the valley between the points of the teeth
fleam the angle of the faces of the teeth relative to a line perpendicular to the face of the saw
rake the angle of the front face of the tooth relative to a line perpendicular to the length of the saw teeth designed to cut with the grain (ripping) are generally steeper than teeth designed to cut across the grain (crosscutting)
points per inch (25 mm) the most common measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade it is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler and then counting the number of points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark inclusive (that is including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark) there is always one more point per inch than there are teeth per inch (e.g. a saw with 14 points per inch will have 13 teeth per inch and a saw with 10 points per inch will have 9 teeth per inch) some saws do not have the same number of teeth per inch throughout their entire length but the vast majority do those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth in order to make starting the saw cut easier
teeth per inch an alternative measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade usually abbreviated tpi as in a blade consisting of 18tpi. [compare points per inch.]
kerf the width of a saw cut which depends on several factors the width of the saw blade the set of the blade's teeth the amount of wobble created during cutting and the amount of material pulled out of the sides of the cut although the term kerf is often used informally to refer simply to the thickness of the saw blade or to the width of the set this can be misleading because blades with the same thickness and set may create different kerfs for example a too-thin blade can cause excessive wobble creating a wider-than-expected kerf the kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter
set the degree to which the teeth are bent out sideways away from the blade usually in both directions in most modern serrated saws the teeth are set so that the kerf (the width of the cut) will be wider than the blade itself this allows the blade to move through the cut easily without binding (getting stuck) the set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make for example a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel so that it rips or tears the material apart a flush-cutting saw has no set on one side so that the saw can be laid flat on a surface and cut along that surface without scratching it the set of the blade's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw tooth setter
abrasive saw a saw that cuts with an abrasive disc or band rather than a serrated blade
== history ==
saws were at first serrated materials such as flint obsidian sea shells and sharks teeth
in ancient egypt open (unframed) saws made of copper are documented as early as the early dynastic period circa 3,1002,686 bc examples of saws used for cutting both wood and stone and as a tool for execution of people and models of saws have been found in many contexts throughout egyptian history particularly useful are tomb wall illustrations of carpenters at work that show sizes and the use of different types egyptian saws were at first serrated hardened copper which cut on both pull and push strokes as the saw developed teeth were raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set saws were also made of bronze and later iron in the iron age frame saws were developed holding the thin blades in tension the earliest known sawmill is the roman hierapolis sawmill from the third century ad and was for sawing stone
according to chinese legend the saw was invented by lu ban in greek mythology as recounted by ovid talos the nephew of daedalus invented the saw in archeological reality saws date back to prehistory and most probably evolved from neolithic stone or bone tools [t]he identities of the axe adz chisel and saw were clearly established more than 4,000 years ago.
=== manufacture of saws by hand ===
until at least the mid-19th century saws were made laboriously by hand the teeth were filed out individually then set by striking alternate teeth with a hammer against a stake or small anvil due to risk of breaking teeth beginners were given saw set pliers which set even more slowly
=== pit saws ===
a pit saw was a two-man rip saw in parts of early colonial north america it was one of the principal tools used in shipyards and other industries where water-powered sawmills were not available it was so-named because it was typically operated over a saw pit either at ground level or on trestles across which logs that were to be cut into boards by the pit-saw were mounted the pit saw was a strong steel cutting-plate of great breadth with large teeth highly polished and thoroughly wrought some eight or ten feet in length with either a handle on either end or a frame saw a pit-saw was also sometimes known as a whipsaw it took 2-4 people to operate a pit-man stood in the pit a top-man stood outside the pit and they worked together to make cuts guide the saw and raise it pit-saw workers were among the most highly paid laborers in early colonial north america
== types of saws ==
=== hand saws ===
hand saws typically have a relatively thick blade to make them stiff enough to cut through material (the pull stroke also reduces the amount of stiffness required.) thin-bladed handsaws are made stiff enough either by holding them in tension in a frame or by backing them with steel or brass (on account of which the latter are called back saws.") some examples of hand saws are
bow saw or buck saw a crosscut saw with the thin blade held in tension in a frame
coping saw for cutting wood patterns
crosscut saw for cutting wood perpendicular to the grain
dovetail saw for cutting intricate joints mainly found in drawers
frame saw or sash saw in general any saw with a thin blade held in tension by a frame this term often specifically means the rip saw also called a whipsaw
fret saw for cutting intricate wood patterns
hacksaw a fine-toothed tempered blade under tension for cutting metal bone and other hard materials
japanese saw or pull saw a thin-bladed saw that cuts on the pull stroke
pad saw or keyhole saw or jab saw a narrow-bladed saw
plywood saw a fine-toothed saw (to reduce tearing) for cutting plywood
rip saw for cutting wood along the grain
turning saw a frame saw with a narrow blade used for cutting curves larger than a coping saw
two-man saw a general term for a large crosscut saw or rip saw for cutting large logs or trees
veneer saw a two-edged saw with fine teeth for cutting veneer
whipsaw or pit saw a kind of rip saw for cutting logs into lumber
wire saw a toothed or coarse cable or wire wrapped around the material and pulled back and forth
==== back saws ====
back saws, so called because they have a thinner blade backed with steel or brass to maintain rigidity are a subset of hand saws back saws have different names depending on the length of the blade some examples are
miter saw for making accurate crosscuts and miters in a workpiece
tenon saw or dovetail saw or sash saw for doing precision cutting in woodworking
=== mechanically powered saws ===
==== circular-blade saws ====
circular saw a saw with a circular blade which spins circular saws can be large for use in a mill or hand held up to 24 blades and different designs cut almost any kind of material including wood stone brick plastic etc
table saw a saw with a circular blade rising through a slot in a table if it has a direct-drive blade small enough to set on a workbench it is called a workbench saw. if set on steel legs it is called a contractor's saw. a heavier more precise and powerful version driven by several belts with an enclosed base stand is called a cabinet saw. a newer version combining the lighter-weight mechanism of a contractor's saw with the enclosed base stand of a cabinet saw is called a hybrid saw.
radial arm saw a versatile machine mainly for cross-cutting the blade is pulled on a guide arm through a piece of wood that is held stationary on the saw's table
rotary saw or spiral-cut saw or rotozip for making accurate cuts without using a pilot hole in wallboard plywood and other thin materials
electric miter saw or chop saw, or cut-off saw or power miter box for making accurate cross cuts and miter cuts the basic version has a circular blade fixed at a 90 angle to the vertical a compound miter saw has a blade that can be adjusted to other angles a sliding compound miter saw has a blade that can be pulled through the work in an action similar to that of a radial-arm saw which provides more capacity for cutting wider workpieces
concrete saw (usually powered by an internal combustion engine and fitted with a diamond blade) for cutting concrete or asphalt pavement
pendulum saw or swing saw a saw hung on a swinging arm for the rough cross cutting of wood in a sawmill and for cutting ice out of a frozen river
abrasive saw a circular or reciprocating saw-like tool with an abrasive disc rather than a toothed blade commonly used for cutting very hard materials as it does not have regularly shaped edges the abrasive saw is not a saw in technical terms
hole saw ring-shaped saw to attach to a power drill used for cutting a circular hole in material
==== reciprocating blade saws ====
jigsaw or saber saw (us) narrow-bladed saw for cutting irregular shapes (also an old term for what is now more commonly called a scroll saw.")
reciprocating saw or sabre saw (uk and australia) a saw with an in-and-out or up-and-down action similar to a jigsaw but larger and more powerful and using a longer stroke with the blade parallel to the barrel hand-held versions sometimes powered by compressed air are for demolition work or for cutting pipe
scroll saw for making intricate curved cuts ("scrolls")
dragsaw for bucking logs (used before the invention of the chainsaw)
frame saw or sash saw a thin bladed rip-saw held in tension by a frame used both manually and in sawmills some whipsaws are frame saws and some have a heavy blade which does not need a frame called a mulay or muley saw
sternal saw for cutting through a patient's sternum during surgery
ice saw for ice cutting looks like a mulay saw but sharpened as a cross-cut saw
==== continuous band ====
band saw a ripsaw on a motor-driven continuous band portable sawmills are typically band saw mills
==== chainsaws ====
chainsaw an engine-driven saw with teeth on a chain normally used as a cross-cut saw
chainsaw mill a chainsaw with a special saw chain and guide system for use as a rip-saw
== types of blades and blade cuts ==
most blade teeth are made either of tool steel or carbide carbide is harder and holds a sharp edge much longer
band saw blade
a long band welded into a circle with teeth on one side compared to a circular-saw blade it produces less waste because it is thinner dissipates heat better because it is longer (so there is more blade to do the cutting and is usually run at a slower speed
crosscut
in woodworking a cut made at (or close to) a right angle to the direction of the wood grain of the workpiece a crosscut saw is used to make this type of cut
rip cut
in woodworking a cut made parallel to the direction of the grain of the workpiece a rip saw is used to make this type of cut
plytooth blade
a circular saw blade with many small teeth designed for cutting plywood with minimal splintering
dado blade
a special type of circular saw blade used for making wide-grooved cuts in wood so that the edge of another piece of wood will fit into the groove to make a joint some dado blades can be adjusted to make different-width grooves a stacked dado blade consisting of chipper blades between two dado blades can make different-width grooves by adding or removing chipper blades an adjustable dado blade has a movable locking cam mechanism to adjust the degree to which the blade wobbles sideways allowing continuously variable groove widths from the lower to upper design limits of the dado
strobe saw blade
a circular saw blade with special rakers/cutters to easily saw through green or uncured wood that tends to jam other kinds of saw blades
== materials used for saws ==
there are several materials used in saws with each of its own specifications
brass
mostly used in back saws because of its low price and its flow characteristics which make it relatively easy to cast brass contributes to the rigidity that is needed in back saws which require less force to operate than other kinds of saws because of the pulling motion involved
steel
used in almost every existing kind of saw because steel is cheap easy to shape and very strong it has the right properties for most kind of saws
diamond
fixed onto the saw blade's base to form diamond saw blades as diamond is a superhard material diamond saw blades can be used to cut hard brittle or abrasive materials for example stone concrete asphalt bricks ceramics glass semiconductor and gem stone there are many methods used to fix the diamonds onto the blades base and there are various kinds of diamond saw blades for different purposes high speed steel (hss) the whole saw blade is made of high speed steel (hss) hss saw blades are mainly used to cut steel copper aluminum and other metal materials if high-strength steels (e.g. stainless steel) are to be cut the blades made of cobalt hss (e.g m35 m42) should be used
tungsten carbide
normally there are two ways to use tungsten carbide to make saw blades
carbide-tipped saw blades the saw blade's teeth are tipped (via welding) with small pieces of sharp tungsten carbide block this type of blade is also called tct (tungsten carbide-tipped) saw blade carbide-tipped saw blades are widely used to cut wood plywood laminated board plastic grass aluminum and some other metals
solid-carbide saw blades the whole saw blade is made of tungsten carbide comparing with hss saw blades solid-carbide saw blades have higher hardness under high temperatures and are more durable but they also have a lower toughness
== uses ==
saws are commonly used for cutting hard materials they are used extensively in forestry construction demolition medicine and hunting
musical saws are used as instruments to make music
chainsaw carving is a flourishing modern art form special saws have been developed for the purpose
the production of lumber lengths of squared wood for use in construction begins with the felling of trees and the transportation of the logs to a sawmill
plainsawing lumber that will be used in structures is typically plainsawn (also called flatsawn) a method of dividing the log that produces the maximum yield of useful pieces and therefore the greatest economy
quarter sawing this sawing method produces edge-grain or vertical grain lumber in which annual growth rings run more consistently perpendicular to the pieces wider faces
