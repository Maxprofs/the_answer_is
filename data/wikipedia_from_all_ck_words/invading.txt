it was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry (see golden age of video arcade games) when first released space invaders was very successful

space invaders was created by tomohiro nishikado who spent a year designing the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it the game's inspiration is reported to have come from varying sources including an adaptation of the mechanical game space monsters released by taito in 1972 and a dream about japanese school children who are waiting for santa claus and are attacked by invading aliens however nishikado has cited atari's arcade game breakout as his inspiration he aimed to create a shooting game that featured the same sense of achievement from completing stages and destroying targets but with more complex graphics nishikado used a similar layout to that of breakout but altered the game mechanics rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects players are given the ability to fire projectiles at their own discretion to attack moving enemies
early enemy designs included tanks combat planes and battleships nishikado however was not satisfied with the enemy movements technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying humans would have been easier to simulate but nishikado considered shooting them immoral after seeing a magazine feature about star wars he thought of using a space theme nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from h g wells the war of the worldshe had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a childand created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs the game was originally titled space monsters inspired by a popular song in japan at the time ("monster") but was changed to space invaders by nishikado's superiors
=== hardwareedit ===
because microcomputers in japan were not powerful enough at the time to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming space invaders nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game he created the arcade board using new microprocessors from the united states the game uses an intel 8080 central processing unit and features raster graphics on a crt monitor and monaural sound hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a texas instruments sn76477 sound chip despite the specially developed hardware nishikado was unable to program the game as he wantedthe control program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies fasterand he considered the development of the hardware the most difficult part of the whole process while programming the game nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster the fewer were on screen rather than design the game to compensate for the speed increase he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanism
space invaders was first released in a cocktail-table format with black and white graphics while the western release by midway was in an upright cabinet format the upright cabinet uses strips of orange and green cellophane over the screen to simulate color graphics the graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a starry background later japanese releases used rainbow-colored cellophane such as t.t space invaders in 1978 followed by a version with a full color display the cabinet artwork features large humanoid monsters not present in the game nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title space monsters rather than referring to the in-game graphics
== musicedit ==
despite its simplicity the music to space invaders was revolutionary in the gaming industry videogame scholar andrew schartmann identifies three aspects of the music that would have a significant impact on the development of game music
whereas videogame music prior to space invaders was restricted to the extremities (i.e. a short introductory theme with game-over counterpart) the alien-inspired hit featured continuous musicthe well-known four-note loopthroughout uninterrupted by sound effects it was thus the first time that sound effects and music were superimposed to form a rich sonic landscape not only do players receive feedback related directly to their actions through sound effects they also receive stimulus in a more subtle non-interactive fashion through music.
the music interacts with on-screen animation to influence the emotions of the player that seemingly pedestrian four-note loop might stir us in the most primitive of ways but that it stirs us at all is worthy of note by demonstrating that game sound could be more than a simple tune to fill the silence space invaders moved videogame music closer to the realm of art.
the music popularized the notion of variabilitythe idea that music can change in accordance with the ongoing narrative the variable in space invaders (tempo) is admittedly simple but its implications are not to be underestimated over the years analogous strategies of variation would be applied to pitch rhythm dynamics form and a host of other parameters all with the goal of accommodating the nonlinear aspect of videogames.
== impact and legacyedit ==
after the first few months following its release in japan the game became very popular specialty arcades opened with nothing but space invaders cabinets and by the end of 1978 taito had installed over 100,000 machines and grossed over $600 million in japan alone within two years by 1980 taito had sold over 300,000 space invaders arcade machines in japan in addition to 60,000 machines in the united states where prices ranged from $2000 to $3000 for each machine within one year the arcade cabinets have since become collector's items with the cocktail and cabaret versions being the rarest by mid-1981 more than four billion quarters or $1 billion had been grossed from space invaders machines and it would continue to gross an average of $600 million a year through to 1982 by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $7.26 billion in 2015) with a net profit of $450 million (equivalent to $1.63 billion in 2015) this made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time with comparisons made to the then highest-grossing film star wars which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets (costing $2.25 each on average) with a net profit of $175 million space invaders had earned taito profits of over $500 million the 1980 atari 2600 version was the first official licensing of an arcade game and became the first killer app for video game consoles by quadrupling the system's sales it sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game making it the first title to sell a million cartridges other official ports of the game were made for the atari 8-bit computer line and atari 5200 console taito released it for the nes in 1985 (japan only) numerous unofficial clones were made as well such as the popular computer games super invader (1979) and ti invaders (1981) which was the top-selling computer game for the ti-99/4a through at least 1982
an oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coinsand subsequent production increasein japan attributed to the game although in actuality 100-yen coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years the claim also doesn't hold up to logical scrutiny arcade operators would have emptied out their machines and taken the money to the bank thus keeping the coins in circulation reports from those living in japan at the time indicate nothing out of the ordinary  during the height of the space invaders invasion.
game designer shigeru miyamoto considers space invaders to be the game that revolutionized the video game industry he was never interested in video games before seeing it hideo kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to space invaders its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month or in some places within one week
technology journalist jason whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977 which had earlier been caused by pong clones flooding the market and beginning the golden age of video arcade games according to the observer the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming many who later became industry leaders 1up.com stated that space invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time movies music and television ign attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in north america in part to space invaders electronic games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time. game informer considered it along with pac-man one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades ign listed it as one of the top 10 most influential games in 2007 citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre the times ranked it no 1 in its list of the ten most influential video games ever in 2007 1up ranked it at no 3 in its list of the 60 most influential games of all time, stating that in contrast to earlier arcade games which were attempts to simulate already-existing things, space invaders was the first video game as a video game instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else. in 2008 guinness world records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical creative and cultural impact in 2015 the world video game hall of fame selected space invaders as one of the finalists for its 2015 induction class
as one of the earliest shooting games it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre space invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score being the first to save the player's score while earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets space invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player it was also the first game where players were given multiple lives had to repel hordes of enemies could take cover from enemy fire and use destructible barriers in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop which was dynamic and changed pace during stages like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached
it also moved the gaming industry away from pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations whittaker commented that space invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles through to contemporary times guinness world records considered space invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008 in describing it as a seminal arcade classic ign listed it as the number eight classic shoot em up space invaders set the template for the shoot em up genre its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games inspiring the development of arcade games such as atari's asteroids williams electronics defender and namco's galaxian and galaga which were modeled after space invaders's gameplay and design this influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day including first-person shooters such as wolfenstein doom halo and call of duty space invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as dungeons of daggorath which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health
