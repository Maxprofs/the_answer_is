package cushioning is used to help protect fragile items during shipment it is common for a transport package to be dropped kicked and impacted these events may produce potentially damaging shocks transportation vibration from conveyors trucks railroads or aircraft can also damage some items shock and vibration are controlled by cushioning so that the chance of product damage is greatly reduced
cushioning is usually inside a shipping container such as a corrugated box it is designed to deform or crush to help keep levels of shock and vibration below levels that may damage the product inside the box depending on the specific situation package cushioning can often be between 50 and 75 millimeters (two to three inches) thick
internal packaging materials (sometimes the same ones used for cushioning) are also used for functions other than cushioning some are used just to immobilize the products in the box and to block them in place others are just used to fill a void and do not have a cushioning function
== design factors ==
when designing packaging the choice of cushioning may depend on many factors
effective protection of product from shock and vibration
whether cushioning is resilient (performs for multiple impacts)
resistance to creep cushion deformation under static load
material costs
labor costs productivity
effects of temperature humidity and air pressure on cushioning
cleanliness of cushioning (dust insects etc.)
effect on size of external shipping container
environmental and recycling issues
sensitivity of product to static electricity
etc
== common types of cushioning ==
loose fill some cushion products are flowable and are packed loosely around the items in the box the box is closed to tighten the pack this includes expanded polystyrene foam pieces (foam peanuts) similar pieces made of starch-based foams and common popcorn the amount of loose fill material required and the transmitted shock levels vary with the specific type of material
paper paper can be manually or mechanically wadded up and used as a cushioning material heavier grades of paper provide more weight-bearing ability than old newspapers creped cellulose wadding is also available (movers often wrap objects with several layers of kraft paper or embossed pulp before putting them into boxes.)
corrugated fiberboard pads multi-layer or cut-and-folded shapes of corrugated board can be used as cushions these structures are designed to crush and deform under shock stress and provide some degree of cushioning paperboard composite honeycomb structures are also used for cushioning
foam structures several types of polymeric foams are used for cushioning the most common are expanded polystyrene (also styrofoam) polypropylene polyethylene and polyurethane these can be molded engineered shapes or sheets which are cut and glued into cushion structures some degradable foams are also available
foam-in-place is another method of using polyurethane foams these fill the box fully encapsulating the product to immobilize it it is also used to form engineered structures
molded pulp pulp can be molded into shapes suitable for cushioning and for immobilizing products in a package molded pulp is made from recycled newspapers and is recyclable
inflated products bubble wrap consists of sheets of plastic film with enclosed bubbles of air these sheets can be layered or wrapped around items to be shipped a variety of engineered inflatable air cushions are also available note that inflated air pillows used for void-fill are not suited for cushioning
other several other types of cushioning are available including suspension cushions thermoformed end caps and clamshells  and shock mounts
== design for shock protection ==
proper performance of cushioning is dependent on its proper design and use it is often best to use a trained packaging engineer reputable vendor consultant or independent laboratory an engineer needs to know the severity of shock (drop height etc.) to protect against this can be based on an existing specification published industry standards and publications field studies etc
knowledge of the product to be packaged is critical field experience may indicate the types of damage previously experienced laboratory analysis can help quantify the fragility of the item often reported in g-s engineering judgment can also be an excellent starting point sometimes a product can be made more rugged or can be supported to make it less susceptible to breakage
the amount of shock transmitted by a particular cushioning material is largely dependent on the thickness of the cushion the drop height and the load-bearing area of the cushion (static loading) a cushion must deform under shock for it to function if a product is on a large load-bearing area the cushion may not deform and will not cushion the shock if the load-bearing area is too small the product may bottom out during a shock the shock is not cushioned engineers use cushion curves to choose the best thickness and load-bearing area for a cushioning material often two to three inches (50 75 mm) of cushioning are needed to protect fragile items
cushion design requires care to prevent shock amplification caused by the cushioned shock pulse duration being close to the natural frequency of the cushioned item
== design for vibration protection ==
the process for vibration protection (or isolation) involves similar considerations as that for shock cushions can be thought of as performing like springs depending on cushion thickness and load-bearing area and on the forcing vibration frequency the cushion may 1) not have any influence on input vibration 2) amplify the input vibration at resonance or 3) isolate the product from the vibration proper design is critical for cushion performance
== evaluation of finished package ==
verification and validation of prototype designs are required the design of a package and its cushioning is often an iterative process involving several designs evaluations redesigns etc several (astm ista and others) published package testing protocols are available to evaluate the performance of a proposed package field performance should be monitored for feedback into the design process
