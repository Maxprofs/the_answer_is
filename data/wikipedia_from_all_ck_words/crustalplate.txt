twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy twins can either be monozygotic ("identical") meaning that they can develop from just one zygote that will then split and form two embryos or dizygotic ("fraternal") meaning that they can develop from two different eggs each are fertilized by separate sperm cells
in contrast a fetus which develops alone in the womb is called a singleton and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is multiple
== statisticsedit ==
the twin birth rate in the united states rose 76% from 1980 through 2009 from 18.9 to 33.3 per 1,000 births (the first successful test tube baby was born in 1978.) the yoruba have the highest rate of twinning in the world at 4550 twin sets (or 90100 twins) per 1,000 live births possibly because of high consumption of a specific type of yam containing a natural phytoestrogen which may stimulate the ovaries to release an egg from each side
in central africa there are 1830 twin sets (or 3660 twins) per 1,000 live births in latin america south asia and southeast asia the lowest rates are found only 69 twin sets per 1,000 live births north america and europe have intermediate rates of 916 twin sets per 1,000 live births
multiple pregnancies are much less likely to carry to full term than single births with twin pregnancies lasting only 37 weeks (3 weeks less than full term) on average
women who have a family history of fraternal twins have a higher chance of producing fraternal twins themselves as there is a genetically linked tendency to hyper-ovulate there is no known genetic link for identical twinning other factors that increase the odds of having fraternal twins include maternal age fertility drugs and other fertility treatments nutrition and prior births
== zygosityedit ==
zygosity is the degree of identity in the genome of twins there are five common variations of twinning and one rare variation
the three most common variations are all dizygotic (fraternal)
malefemale twins are the most common result 50 percent of dizygotic twins and the most common grouping of twins
femalefemale dizygotic twins (sometimes called sororal twins")
malemale dizygotic twins
the other two variations are monozygotic ("identical") twins
femalefemale monozygotic twins
malemale monozygotic twins (less common)
malefemale monozygotic twins (without chromosomal abnormalities) (very rare only few cases known)
among non-twin births male singletons are slightly (about five percent) more common than female singletons the rates for singletons vary slightly by country for example the sex ratio of birth in the us is 1.05 males/female while it is 1.07 males/female in italy however males are also more susceptible than females to die in utero and since the death rate in utero is higher for twins it leads to female twins being more common than male twins
=== dizygotic (fraternal) twinsedit ===
dizygotic (dz) or fraternal twins (also referred to as non-identical twins dissimilar twins biovular twins and informally in the case of females sororal twins") usually occur when two fertilized eggs are implanted in the uterus wall at the same time when two eggs are independently fertilized by two different sperm cells fraternal twins result the two eggs or ova form two zygotes hence the terms dizygotic and biovular fraternal twins are essentially two ordinary siblings who happen to be born at the same time since they arise from two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm just like ordinary siblings instead of fraternal twins this situation can also occasionally result in a chimera someone colloquially described as their own fraternal twin
dizygotic twins like any other siblings have an extremely small chance of having the same chromosome profile even if they happen to have the same chromosome profile they will always have different genetic material on each chromosome due to chromosomal crossover during meiosis like any other siblings dizygotic twins may look similar particularly given that they are the same age however dizygotic twins may also look very different from each other
studies show that there is a genetic basis for dizygotic twinning however it is only the mother who has any effect on the chances of having such twins there is no known mechanism for a father to cause the release of more than one ovum dizygotic twinning ranges from six per thousand births in japan (similar to the rate of monozygotic twins) to 14 and more per thousand in some african countries
dizygotic twins are also more common for older mothers with twinning rates doubling in mothers over the age of 35 with the advent of technologies and techniques to assist women in getting pregnant the rate of fraternals has increased markedly
=== monozygotic (identical) twinsedit ===
monozygotic (mz) or identical twins occur when a single egg is fertilized to form one zygote (hence monozygotic") which then divides into two separate embryos
==== mechanismedit ====
regarding spontaneous or natural monozygotic twinning a recent theory proposes that monozygotic twins are formed after a blastocyst essentially collapses splitting the progenitor cells (those that contain the body's fundamental genetic material) in half leaving the same genetic material divided in two on opposite sides of the embryo eventually two separate fetuses develop spontaneous division of the zygote into two embryos is not considered to be a hereditary trait but rather a spontaneous or in some cases a random event
monozygotic twins may also be created artificially by embryo splitting it can be used as an expansion of ivf to increase the number of available embryos for embryo transfer
==== incidenceedit ====
monozygotic twinning occurs in birthing at a rate of about three in every 1000 deliveries worldwide
the likelihood of a single fertilization resulting in monozygotic twins is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world this is in marked contrast to dizygotic twinning which ranges from about six per thousand births in japan (almost similar to the rate of identical twins which is around 45) to 15 and more per thousand in some parts of india and up to over 20 in some central african countries the exact cause for the splitting of a zygote or embryo is unknown
in vitro fertilization (ivf) techniques are more likely to create dizygotic twins for ivf deliveries there are nearly 21 pairs of twins for every 1,000
==== genetic and epigenetic similarityedit ====
monozygotic twins are genetically nearly identical and they are always the same sex unless there has been a mutation during development the children of monozygotic twins test genetically as half-siblings (or full siblings if a pair of monozygotic twins reproduces with another pair or with the same person) rather than first cousins identical twins do not have the same fingerprints due to the fact that even in a small space inside the womb people have contact with different parts of this environment which gives small variations in the same digital making them unique monozygotic twins always have different phenotypes normally due to an environmental factor or the deactivation of different x chromosomes in female monozygotic twins and in some extremely rare cases due to aneuploidy twins may express different sexual phenotypes normally from an xxy klinefelter syndrome zygote splitting unevenly
monozygotic twins although genetically very similar are not genetically exactly the same the dna in white blood cells of 66 pairs of monozygotic twins was analyzed for 506,786 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to occur in human populations polymorphisms appeared in 2 of the 33 million comparisons leading the researchers to extrapolate that the blood cells of monozygotic twins may have on the order of one dna-sequence difference for every 1.2 x 107 nucleotides which would imply hundreds of differences across the entire genome the mutations producing the differences detected in this study would have occurred during embryonic cell-division (after the point of fertilization) if they occur early in fetal development they will be present in a very large proportion of body cells
another cause of difference between monozygotic twins is epigenetic modification caused by differing environmental influences throughout their lives epigenetics refers to the level of activity of any particular gene a gene may become switched on switched off or could become partially switched on or off in an individual this epigenetic modification is triggered by environmental events monozygotic twins can have markedly different epigenetic profiles a study of 80 pairs of monozygotic twins ranging in age from three to 74 showed that the youngest twins have relatively few epigenetic differences the number of epigenetic differences increases with age fifty-year-old twins had over three times the epigenetic difference of three-year-old twins twins who had spent their lives apart (such as those adopted by two different sets of parents at birth) had the greatest difference however certain characteristics become more alike as twins age such as iq and personality this phenomenon illustrates the influence of genetics in many aspects of human characteristics and behavior
a 1981 study of a deceased triploid xxx twin fetus without a heart showed that although its fetal development suggested that it was an identical twin as it shared a placenta with its healthy twin tests revealed that it was probably a polar body twin the authors were unable to predict whether a healthy fetus could result from a polar body twinning in 2003 a study argued that many cases of triploidity arise from semi-identical twinning in 2007 a study reported a case of a pair of living twins one intersex and one a phenotypical male the twins were both found to be chimeras and to share all of their maternal dna but only half of their father's dna the exact mechanism of fertilization could not be determined but the study stated that it was unlikely to be a case of polar body twinning
== degree of separationedit ==
the degree of separation of the twins in utero depends on if and when they split into two zygotes dizygotic twins were always two zygotes monozygotic twins split into two zygotes at some time very early in the pregnancy the timing of this separation determines the chorionicity (the number of placentae) and amniocity (the number of sacs) of the pregnancy dichorionic twins either never divided (i.e. were dizygotic) or they divided within the first 4 days monoamnionic twins divide after the first week
in very rare cases twins become conjoined twins furthermore there can be various degrees of shared environment of twins in the womb potentially leading to pregnancy complications
it is a common misconception that two placentas means twins are dizygotic but if monozygotic twins separate early enough the arrangement of sacs and placentas in utero is indistinguishable from dizygotic twins
== demographicsedit ==
a 2006 study has found that insulin-like growth factor present in dairy products may increase the chance of dizygotic twinning specifically the study found that vegan mothers (who exclude dairy from their diets) are one-fifth as likely to have twins as vegetarian or omnivore mothers and concluded that genotypes favoring elevated igf and diets including dairy products especially in areas where growth hormone is given to cattle appear to enhance the chances of multiple pregnancies due to ovarian stimulation.
from 1980 to 1997 the number of twin births in the united states rose 52% this rise can at least partly be attributed to the increasing popularity of fertility drugs like clomid and procedures such as ivf which result in multiple births more frequently than unassisted fertilizations do it may also be linked to the increase of growth hormones in food
=== ethnicityedit ===
about 1 in 90 human births (1.1%) results from a twin pregnancy the rate of dizygotic twinning varies greatly among ethnic groups ranging as high as about 45 per 1000 births (4.5%) for the yoruba to 10% for linha so pedro a tiny brazilian settlement which belongs to the city of cndido godi in cndido godi one in five pregnancies has resulted in twins the argentine historian jorge camarasa has put forward a theory that experiments of the nazi doctor josef mengele could be responsible for the high ratio of twins in the area his theory was rejected by brazilian scientists who had studied twins living in linha so pedro they suggested genetic factors within that community as a more likely explanation a high twinning rate has also been observed in other places of the world including 
igbo-ora in nigeria
kodinji located in kerala india
mohammadpur umri located in uttar pradesh india
the widespread use of fertility drugs causing hyperovulation (stimulated release of multiple eggs by the mother) has caused what some call an epidemic of multiple births in 2001 for the first time ever in the us the twinning rate exceeded 3% of all births nevertheless the rate of monozygotic twins remains at about 1 in 333 across the globe
in a study on the maternity records of 5750 hausa women living in the savannah zone of nigeria there were 40 twins and 2 triplets per 1000 births twenty-six percent of twins were monozygotic the incidence of multiple births which was about five times higher than that observed in any western population was significantly lower than that of other ethnic groups who live in the hot and humid climate of the southern part of the country the incidence of multiple births was related to maternal age but did not bear any association to the climate or prevalence of malaria
=== predisposing factorsedit ===
the predisposing factors of monozygotic twinning are unknown
dizygotic twin pregnancies are slightly more likely when the following factors are present in the woman
she is of west african descent (especially yoruba)
she is between the age of 30 and 40 years
she is greater than average height and weight
she has had several previous pregnancies
women undergoing certain fertility treatments may have a greater chance of dizygotic multiple births in the united states it has been estimated that by 2011 36% of twin births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology
the risk of twin birth can vary depending on what types of fertility treatments are used with in vitro fertilisation (ivf) this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus ovarian hyperstimulation without ivf has a very high risk of multiple birth reversal of anovulation with clomifene (trade names including clomid) has a relatively less but yet significant risk of multiple pregnancy
== delivery intervaledit ==
a 15-year german study of 8,220 vaginally delivered twins (that is 4,110 pregnancies) in hesse yielded a mean delivery time interval of 13.5 minutes the delivery interval between the twins was measured as follows
within 15 minutes 75.8%
16-30 minutes 16.4%
31-45 minutes 4.3%
46-60 minutes 1.7%
over 60 minutes 1.8% (72 instances)
the study stated that the occurrence of complications was found to be more likely with increasing twin-to-twin delivery time interval and suggested that the interval be kept short though it noted that the study did not examine causes of complications and did not control for factors such as the level of experience of the obstetrician the wish of the women giving birth or the management strategies of the procedure of delivering the second twin
== complications during pregnancyedit ==
=== vanishing twinsedit ===
researchers suspect that as many as 1 in 8 pregnancies start out as multiples but only a single fetus is brought to full term because the other fetus has died very early in the pregnancy and has not been detected or recorded early obstetric ultrasonography exams sometimes reveal an extra fetus which fails to develop and instead disintegrates and vanishes in the uterus there are several reasons for the vanishing fetus including it being embodied or absorbed by the other fetus placenta or the mother this is known as vanishing twin syndrome also in an unknown proportion of cases two zygotes may fuse soon after fertilization resulting in a single chimeric embryo and later fetus
=== conjoined twinsedit ===
conjoined twins (or the commonly used term siamese") are monozygotic twins whose bodies are joined together during pregnancy this occurs when the zygote starts to split after day 12 following fertilization and fails to separate completely this condition occurs in about 1 in 50,000 human pregnancies most conjoined twins are now evaluated for surgery to attempt to separate them into separate functional bodies the degree of difficulty rises if a vital organ or structure is shared between twins such as the brain heart or liver
=== chimerismedit ===
a chimera is an ordinary person or animal except that some of their parts actually came from their twin or from the mother a chimera may arise either from monozygotic twin fetuses (where it would be impossible to detect) or from dizygotic fetuses which can be identified by chromosomal comparisons from various parts of the body the number of cells derived from each fetus can vary from one part of the body to another and often leads to characteristic mosaicism skin coloration in human chimeras a chimera may be intersex composed of cells from a male twin and a female twin in one case dna tests determined that a woman mystifyingly was not the mother of two of her three children she was found to be a chimera and the two children were conceived from eggs derived from cells of their mother's twin
=== parasitic twinsedit ===
sometimes one twin fetus will fail to develop completely and continue to cause problems for its surviving twin one fetus acts as a parasite towards the other sometimes the parasitic twin becomes an almost indistinguishable part of the other and sometimes this needs to be treated medically
=== partial molar twinsedit ===
a very rare type of parasitic twinning is one where a single viable twin is endangered when the other zygote becomes cancerous or molar this means that the molar zygote's cellular division continues unchecked resulting in a cancerous growth that overtakes the viable fetus typically this results when one twin has either triploidy or complete paternal uniparental disomy resulting in little or no fetus and a cancerous overgrown placenta resembling a bunch of grapes
=== miscarried twinedit ===
occasionally a woman will suffer a miscarriage early in pregnancy yet the pregnancy will continue one twin was miscarried but the other was able to be carried to term this occurrence is similar to the vanishing twin syndrome but typically occurs later as the twin is not reabsorbed
=== low birth weightedit ===
it is very common for twins to be born at a low birth weight more than half of twins are born weighing less than 5.5 pounds while the average birth weight of a healthy baby should be around 7.5-8.0 pounds this is largely due to the fact that twins are typically born premature premature birth and low birth weights especially when under 3.5 pounds can increase the risk of several health-related issues such as vision and hearing loss mental disabilities and cerebral palsy there is an increased possibility of potential complications as the birth weight of the baby decreases
=== twin-to-twin transfusion syndromeedit ===
monozygotic twins who share a placenta can develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome this condition means that blood from one twin is being diverted into the other twin one twin the donor twin is small and anemic the other the recipient twin is large and polycythemic the lives of both twins are endangered by this condition
=== stillbirthsedit ===
stillbirths occurs when a fetus dies after 20 weeks of gestation there are two types of stillbirth including intrauterine death and intrapartum death intrauterine death occurs when a baby dies during late pregnancy intrapartum death which is more common occurs when a baby dies while the mother is giving birth.the cause of stillbirth is often unknown but the rate of babies who are stillborn is higher in twins and multiple births caesareans or inductions are advised after 38 weeks of pregnancy because the risk of stillbirth increases after this time
== management of birthedit ==
for otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for the infant as compared with caesarean section there is controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not when the first twin is not head down a c-section is often recommended it is estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the united states were delivered by cesarean section in 2008 in comparison the rate of cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 14% and 40%
== human twin studiesedit ==
twin studies are utilized in an attempt to determine how much of a particular trait is attributable to either genetics or environmental influence these studies compare monozygotic and dizygotic twins for medical genetic or psychological characteristics to try to isolate genetic influence from epigenetic and environmental influence twins that have been separated early in life and raised in separate households are especially sought-after for these studies which have been used widely in the exploration of human nature classical twin studies are now being supplemented with molecular genetic studies which identify individual genes
=== unusual twinningsedit ===
among dizygotic twins in rare cases the eggs are fertilized at different times with two or more acts of sexual intercourse either within one menstrual cycle (superfecundation) or even more rarely later on in the pregnancy (superfetation) this can lead to the possibility of a woman carrying fraternal twins with different fathers (that is half-siblings) this phenomenon is known as heteropaternal superfecundation one 1992 study estimates that the frequency of heteropaternal superfecundation among dizygotic twins whose parents were involved in paternity suits was approximately 2.4% see the references section below for more details
dizygotic twins from biracial couples can sometimes be mixed twins which exhibit differing ethnic and racial features one such pairing was born in germany in 2008 to a white father from germany and a black mother from ghana
heterotopic pregnancy is an exceedingly rare type of dizygotic twinning in which one twin implants in the uterus as normal and the other remains in the fallopian tube as an ectopic pregnancy ectopic pregnancies must be resolved because they can be life-threatening to the mother however in most cases the intrauterine pregnancy can be salvaged
among monozygotic twins in extremely rare cases twins have been born with different sexes (one male one female) when monozygotic twins are born with different sexes it is because of chromosomal defects there can be monozygotic boy/girl twins if the sex gene of the embryo has an extra x chromosome (the fertilized egg would be an xxy) then when the egg splits one can have xx (girl) genes and one can have xy (boy) genes this is rare but possible records show there are only 10 known cases of these type twins the probability of this is so small that multiples having different sexes is universally accepted as a sound basis for in utero clinical determination that the multiples are not monozygotic another abnormality that can result in monozygotic twins of different genders is if the egg is fertilized by a male sperm but during cell division only the x chromosome is duplicated this results in one normal male (xy) and one female with turner syndrome (45,x) in these cases although the twins did form from the same fertilized egg it is incorrect to refer to them as genetically identical since they have different karyotypes
=== semi-identical twinsedit ===
monozygotic twins can develop differently due to different genes being activated more unusual are semi-identical twins these half-identical twins are hypothesized to occur when an unfertilized egg cleaves into two identical attached ova and which are viable for fertilization both cloned ova are then fertilized by different sperm and the coalesced eggs undergo further cell duplications developing as a chimeric blastomere if this blastomere then undergoes a twinning event two embryos will be formed each of which have different paternal genes and identical maternal genes
this results in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side but different genes from the father's side cells in each fetus carry genes from either sperm resulting in chimeras this form had been speculated until only recently being recorded in western medicine
=== mirror image twinsedit ===
mirror image twins result when a fertilized egg splits later in the embryonic stage than normal timing around day 9-12 this type of twinning could exhibit characteristics with reversed asymmetry such as opposite dominant handedness dental structure or even organs (situs inversus) if the split occurs later than this time period the twins risk being conjoined there is no dna-based zygosity test that can determine if twins are indeed mirror image
== language developmentedit ==
there have been many studies highlighting the development of language in twins compared to single-born children these studies have converged on the notion that there is a greater rate of delay in language development in twins compared to their single-born counterparts the reasons for this phenomenon are still in question however idioglossia was thought to be the major cause idioglossia is defined as a private language that is invented usually by young children specifically twins the increased focused communication between two twins may isolate them from the social environment surrounding them idioglossia has been found to be a rare occurrence and the attention of scientists has shifted away from this idea current research is looking into the impacts of a richer social environment for these twins to stimulate their development of language
== other animalsedit ==
twins are common in many animal species including cats sheep ferrets giant pandas dogs deer marmosets and tamarins the incidence of twinning among cattle is about 14% and research is under way to improve the odds of twinning which can be more profitable for the breeder if complications can be sidestepped or managed a female calf that is the twin of a bull becomes partially masculinized and is known as a freemartin
