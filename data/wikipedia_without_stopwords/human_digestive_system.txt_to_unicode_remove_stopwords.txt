human digestive system process digestion many stages first starts mouth oral cavity digestion involves breakdown food smaller smaller components absorbed assimilated body secretion saliva helps produce bolus swallowed pass oesophagus stomach
saliva also contains catalytic enzyme called amylase starts act food mouth another digestive enzyme called lingual lipase secreted lingual papillae tongue also serous glands main salivary glands digestion helped mastication food teeth also muscular actions peristalsis segmentation contractions gastric juice stomach essential continuation digestion production mucus stomach
peristalsis rhythmic contraction muscles begins oesophagus continues along wall stomach rest gastrointestinal tract initially results production chyme fully broken small intestine absorbed chyle lymphatic system digestion food takes place small intestine water minerals reabsorbed back blood colon large intestine waste products digestion defecated anus via rectum
digestive system componentsedit
several organs components involved digestion food organs known accessory digestive glands liver gall bladder pancreas components include mouth teeth epiglottis
largest structure digestive system gastrointestinal tract gi tract starts mouth ends anus covering distance nine metres
largest part gi tract colon large intestine water absorbed remaining waste matter stored prior defecation
digestion food takes place small intestine
major digestive organ stomach within mucosa millions embedded gastric glands secretions vital functioning organ
