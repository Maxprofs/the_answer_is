march assembly adopted committees proposed principles new decimal system measure authorised survey dunkirk barcelona establish length meridian july committee proposed names metre litre grave units length area capacity mass respectively committee also proposed multiples submultiples units denoted decimalbased prefixes centi hundredth kilo thousand

unit names
names units follow grammatical rules associated common nouns english french start lowercase letter eg newton hertz pascal even symbol unit begins capital letter also applies degrees celsius since degree unit german however names units german nouns start capital letters spelling unit names matter guardians language concerned official british american spellings certain si units differ british english well australian canadian new zealand english uses spelling deca metre litre whereas american english uses spelling deka meter liter respectively
likewise plural forms units follow grammar language concerned english normal rules english grammar used eg henries plural henry however units lux hertz siemens irregular plurals remain singular plural form
english unit names combined denote multiplication units concerned separated hyphen space eg newtonmetre newton metre plural formed converting last unit name plural form eg ten newtonmetres
unit names adjectives
english space recommended number unit symbol used adjective eg kg sphere
normal rules english apply unit names hyphen incorporated adjectival sense eg kilogram sphere

general rules
general rules writing si units quantities apply text either handwritten produced using automated process
value quantity written number followed space representing multiplication sign unit symbol eg kg m k rule explicitly includes percent sign symbol degrees temperature c exceptions symbols plane angular degrees minutes seconds placed immediately number intervening space
symbols mathematical entities abbreviations appended periodfull stop unless rules grammar demand one another reason denoting end sentence
prefix part unit symbol prepended unit symbol without separator eg k km m mpa g ghz compound prefixes allowed
symbols derived units formed multiplication joined centre dot nonbreaking space eg nm n m
symbols derived units formed division joined solidus given negative exponent eg metre per second written ms m ms ms one solidus used eg kgms kgms acceptable kgms ambiguous unacceptable
first letter symbols units derived name person written upper case otherwise written lower case eg unit pressure named blaise pascal symbol written pa symbol mole written mol thus symbol tesla measure magnetic field strength symbol tonne measure mass since litre may exceptionally written using either uppercase l lowercase l decision prompted similarity lowercase letter l numeral especially certain typefaces englishstyle handwriting american nist recommends within united states l used rather l
symbols units plural form eg kg kgs
uppercase lowercase prefixes interchangeable eg quantities mw mw represent two different quantities former typical power requirement hearing aid milliwatt watts latter typical power requirement suburban train megawatt watts
