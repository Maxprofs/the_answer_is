carbohydrate catabolism breakdown carbohydrates yield energy rich compound called atp production atp achieved oxidation glucose molecules oxidation electrons stripped glucose molecule reduce nad fad nad fad possess high energy potential drive production atp electron transport chain atp production occurs mitochondria cell two methods producing atp aerobic anaerobic aerobic respiration oxygen required oxygen plays key role increases atp production atp molecules atp molecules anaerobic respiration oxygen required oxygen absent generation atp continues fermentationthere two types fermentation alcohol fermentation lactic acid fermentation
several different types carbohydrates polysaccharides eg starch amylopectin glycogen cellulose monosaccharides eg glucose galactose fructose ribose disaccharides eg sucrose maltose lactose
glucose reacts oxygen following redox reaction cho o co ho carbon dioxide water waste products overall reaction exothermic
breakdown glucose energy form molecules atp therefore one important biochemical pathways found living organisms
glycolysis
glycolysis means sugar splitting initial process cellular respiration pathway glycolysis either aerobic anaerobic process oxygen present glycolysis continue along aerobic respiration pathway oxygen present atp production restricted anaerobic respiration location glycolysis aerobic anaerobic occurs cytosol cell glycolysis sixcarbon glucose molecule split two threecarbon molecules called pyruvate carbon molecules oxidized nadh atp order glucose molecule oxidized pyruvate input atp molecules required known investment phase total two atp molecules consumed end glycolysis total yield atp four molecules net gain two atp molecules even though atp synthesized two atp molecules produced compared second third pathways krebs cycle oxidative phosphorylation
fermentation
even oxygen present glycolysis continue generate atp however order glycolysis continue produce atp must nad present responsible oxidizing glucose achieved recycling nadh back nad nad reduced nadh electrons nadh eventually transferred separate organic molecule transforming nadh back nad process renewing supply nad called fermentation falls two categories
alcohol fermentation
alcohol fermentation glucose molecule oxidized ethanol ethyl alcohol carbon dioxide byproducts organic molecule responsible renewing nad supply type fermentation pyruvate glycolysis pyruvate release carbon dioxide molecule turning acetaldehyde acetaldehyde reduced nadh produced glycolysis forming alcohol waste product ethanol forming nad thereby replenishing supply glycolysis continue producing atp
lactic acid fermentation
lactic acid fermentation pyruvate molecule directly reduced nadh byproduct type fermentation lactate lactic acid fermentation used human muscle cells means generating atp strenuous exercise oxygen consumption higher supplied oxygen process progresses surplus lactate brought liver converted back pyruvate

citric acid cycle also known krebs cycle
