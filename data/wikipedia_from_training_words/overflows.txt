== etymology ==
the etymology and historical meaning of the term professional is from middle english from profes adjective having professed one's vows from anglo-french from late latin professus from latin past participle of profitri to profess confess from pro- before + fatri to acknowledge in other senses from latin professus past participle
thus as people became more and more specialized in their trade they began to profess their skill to others and vow to perform their trade to the highest known standard with a reputation to uphold trusted workers of a society who have a specific trade are considered professionals
ironically the usage of the word profess declined from the late 1800s to the 1950s just as the term professional was gaining popularity from 1900-2010
