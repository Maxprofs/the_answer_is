homeostasis homoeostasis homeo stasis property system variables regulated internal conditions remain stable relatively constant examples homeostasis include regulation temperature balance acidity alkalinity ph process maintains stability human bodys internal environment response changes external conditions
concept described french physiologist claude bernard word coined walter bradford cannon although term originally used refer processes within living organisms frequently applied automatic control systems thermostats homeostasis requires sensor detect changes condition regulated effector mechanism vary condition negative feedback connection two
biological
living organisms depend maintaining complex set interacting metabolic chemical reactions simplest unicellular organisms complex plants animals internal processes operate keep conditions within tight limits allow reactions proceed homeostatic processes act level cell tissue organ well organism whole
principal homeostatic processes include following
warmblooded endothermic animals mammals birds maintain constant body temperature whereas ectothermic animals almost animals exhibit wide body temperature variation advantage temperature regulation allows organism function effectively broad range environmental conditions example ectotherms tend become sluggish low temperatures whereas colocated endotherm may fully active thermal stability comes price since automatic regulation system requires additional energy temperature rises body loses heat sweating panting via latent heat evaporation falls counteracted increased metabolic action shivering andin fur feathercoated creaturesby thickening coat
regulation cell number cell size maintain organ size function
regulation ph blood measure alkalinity acidity
animals also regulate blood glucose concentration mammals regulate blood glucose insulin glucagon human body maintains glucose levels constant day even hour fast even long periods fasting glucose levels reduced slightly insulin secreted beta cells pancreas effectively transports glucose bodys cells instructing cells keep glucose use see dynamic equilibrium glucose inside cells high cells convert insoluble glycogen prevent soluble glucose interfering cellular metabolism ultimately lowers blood glucose levels insulin helps prevent hyperglycemia insulin deficient cells become resistant diabetes occurs glucagon secreted alpha cells pancreas encourages cells break stored glycogen convert noncarbohydrate carbon sources glucose via gluconeogenesis thus preventing hypoglycemia
kidneys used remove excess water ions blood expelled urine kidneys perform vital role homeostatic regulation mammals removing excess water salt urea blood
water content blood lymph fluid falls restored first instance extracting water cells throat mouth become dry symptoms thirst motivate animal drink
oxygen content blood falls carbondioxide concentration increases blood flow increased vigorous heart action speed depth breathing increases
sleep timing depends upon balance homeostatic sleep propensity need sleep function amount time elapsed since last adequate sleep episode circadian rhythms determine ideal timing correctly structured restorative sleep episode
personality traits often conceptualized person specific setpoint level around mood states fluctuate time
control mechanisms
homeostatic control mechanisms least three interdependent components variable regulated receptor sensing component monitors responds changes environment receptor senses stimulus sends information control center component sets range variable maintained control center determines appropriate response stimulus control center sends signals effector muscles organs structures receive signals control center receiving signal change occurs correct deviation depressing negative feedback
negative feedback
negative feedback mechanisms consist reducing output activity organ system back normal range functioning good example regulating blood pressure blood vessels sense resistance blood flow walls blood pressure increases blood vessels act receptors relay message brain brain sends message heart blood vessels effectors heart rate would decrease blood vessels increase diameter known vasodilation change would cause blood pressure fall back normal range opposite would happen blood pressure decreases would cause vasoconstriction
another important example seen body deprived food body would reset metabolic set point lower normal value would allow body continue function slower rate even though body starving therefore people depriving food trying lose weight would find easy shed weight initially much harder lose due bodys readjusting lower metabolic setpoint allow body survive low supply energy exercise change effect increasing metabolic demand
another good example negative feedback mechanism temperature control hypothalamus monitors body temperature capable determining even slightest variation normal body temperature degrees celsius response variation could stimulation glands produce sweat reduce temperature signaling various muscles shiver increase body temperature
feedbacks equally important healthy functioning ones body complications arise two feedbacks affected altered way
homeostatic imbalance
many diseases involve disturbance homeostasis
organism ages efficiency control systems becomes reduced inefficiencies gradually result unstable internal environment increases risk illness leads physical changes associated aging
certain homeostatic imbalances high core temperature high concentration salt blood low concentration oxygen generate homeostatic emotions warmth thirst breathlessness motivate behavior aimed restoring homeostasis removing sweater drinking slowing
examples technology
following examples familiar homeostatic mechanisms
thermostat operates switching heaters airconditioners response output temperature sensor
cruise control adjusts cars throttle response changes speed
autopilot operates steering controls aircraft ship response deviation preset compass bearing route
process control systems chemical plant oil refinery maintain fluid levels pressures temperature chemical composition etc controlling heaters pumps valves
centrifugal governor steam engine designed james watt reduces throttle valve response increases engine speed opens valve speed falls preset rate
ecological
concept homeostasis central topic ecological stoichiometry refers relationship chemical composition organism chemical composition nutrients consumes stoichiometric homeostasis helps explain nutrient recycling population dynamics
throughout history ecological succession seen stable endstage called climax see frederic clements sometimes referred potential biodiversity site shaped primarily local climate idea largely abandoned modern ecologists favor nonequilibrium ideas ecosystems function natural ecosystems experience disturbance rate makes climax community unattainable
small isolated habitats known ecological islands phenomenon observed one case study island krakatoa major eruption established stable homeostasis previous forest climax ecosystem destroyed life eliminated island years eruption krakatoa went sequence ecological changes successive groups new plant animal species followed one another leading increasing biodiversity eventually culminating reestablished climax community ecological succession krakatoa occurred number stages sere defined stage sequence events succession occurs complete chain seres leading climax called prisere case krakatoa island reached climax community eight hundred different recorded species one hundred years eruption cleared life island evidence confirms number homeostatic time introduction new species rapidly leading elimination old ones evidence krakatoa disturbed island ecosystems confirmed many principles island biogeography mimicking general principles ecological succession albeit virtually closed system comprised almost exclusively endemic species
biosphere
gaia hypothesis james lovelock stated entire mass living matter earth planet life functions vast homeostatic superorganism actively modifies planetary environment produce environmental conditions necessary survival view entire planet maintains homeostasis whether sort system present earth still open debate however relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms generally accepted example sometimes claimed atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise certain plants able grow better thus act remove carbon dioxide atmosphere however warming exacerbated droughts making water actual limiting factor land sunlight plentiful atmospheric temperature climbs claimed phytoplankton ocean surface waters may thrive produce dimethyl sulfide dms dms molecules act cloud condensation nuclei produce clouds thus increase atmospheric albedo feeds back lower temperature atmosphere however rising sea temperature stratified oceans separating warm sunlit waters cool nutrientrich waters thus nutrients become limiting factor plankton levels actually fallen past years risen scientists discover earth vast numbers positive negative feedback loops discovered together maintain metastable condition sometimes within broad range environmental conditions
environmental pressure competition change temperature lead adaptationextinction species time
reactive
example use reactive homeostasis immediate homeostatic response challenge predation
however homeostasis impossible without reactionbecause homeostasis must feedback phenomenon
phrase reactive homeostasis simply short reactive compensation reestablishing homeostasis say reestablishing point homeostasis confused separate kind homeostasis distinct phenomenon homeostasis simply compensation compensatory phase homeostasis
fields
term come used fields example
risk
actuary may refer risk homeostasis example people antilock brakes better safety record without antilock brakes former unconsciously compensate safer vehicle via lesssafe driving habits previous innovation antilock brakes certain maneuvers involved minor skids evoking fear avoidance antilock system moves boundary feedback behavior patterns expand nolonger punitive area also suggested ecological crises instance risk homeostasis particular behavior continues proven dangerous dramatic consequences actually occur
stress
sociologists psychologists may refer stress homeostasis tendency population individual stay certain level stress often generating artificial stresses natural level stress enough
jeanfranois lyotard postmodern theorist applied term societal power centers describes governed principle homeostasis example scientific hierarchy sometimes ignore radical new discovery years destabilises previously accepted norms see postmodern condition report knowledge jeanfranois lyotard
